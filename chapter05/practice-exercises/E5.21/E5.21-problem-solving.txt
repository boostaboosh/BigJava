Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (1 for January, 2 for February,
etc.) and then prints the number of days in the month. For February, print “28
days”.
Enter a month: 5
30 days
Use a class Month with a method
public int getLength()
Do not use a separate if/else branch for each month. Use Boolean operators.

creating a class from a given specification:
step 1 - Find out which methods you are asked to supply
- a method which returns the number of days in a given month

step 2 - Specify the public interface of your class
This is easier if I create and call methods on a sample object and then reverse engineer the public interface of said
methods:
Month jan = new Month(1);
int days = jan.getLength();
Now I can deduce the public interface of the methods of my class with specific types for return values and parameter
variables:
public int getLength()
I must also provide the users of my class with at least one constructor. I must ask myself how many constructors I want
and what information I need in order to construct an object of my class.
public Month(int monthNumber)

step 3 - comment the public interface of your class

step 4 - determine instance variables
Ask yourself what information instances of month objects need in order to do what they need to do.
Importantly, do not introduce unnecessary instance variables. If a value can be computed on demand it is best to do so.

step 5 - implement the hidden implementation of constructors and methods of the Month class

step 6 - test the month class
