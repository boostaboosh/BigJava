Write a program that reads a floating-point number and prints “zero” if the number
is zero. Otherwise, print “positive” or “negative”. Add “small” if the absolute value
of the number is less than 1, or “large” if it exceeds 1,000,000.

Computation problem-solving method (Big Java: Early Objects, chapter 4: How To 4.1 - Carrying out computations)

step 1 - understand the problem. What are the inputs to this problem and what are the desired outputs?
In this problem there is one input.
inputs:
1 - a floating point number
In this problem there are two outputs.
outputs:
1 - "zero", "positive", or "negative"
2 - "large" or "small"

step 2 - work out examples by hand
1)
input: 1'000'001.2343
output: positive large
2)
input: 0
output: zero small
3)
input: 0.00000002123
output: positive small
4)
input: -0.213
output: negative small
5)
input: -1232
output: negative

step 3 - write an algorithm in pseudocode that works for solving general instances of the problem based on the specific
instances of the problem solved in step 2.

ask user to input a floating point number

if input is not a floating point number
   tell user input was not a floating point number and therefore invalid
else
   if input > 0
      output = "positive"
   else if output < 0
      output = "negative"
   else
      output = "zero"

   if absolute value of input < 1
      output = output + small
   else if absolute value of input > 1_000_000
      output = output + large

   print output

step 4 - declare the variables and constants you need and specify their types
final double SMALL_NUMBER = 1;
final double LARGE_NUMBER = 1_000_000;
double input;
String output;

step 5 - Turn the pseudocode into Java statements

import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * A class which contains a program which reads a floating-point number and prints “zero” if the number
 * is zero. Otherwise, print “positive” or “negative”. Adds “small” if the absolute value of the number is
 * less than 1, or “large” if it exceeds 1,000,000.
 */
public class Main
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      final double SMALL_NUMBER = 1;
      final double LARGE_NUMBER = 1_000_000;
      double number;
      String output;

      Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.print("Input a floating point number: ");
      if (!input.hasNextDouble())
      {
         System.out.print("Input was not a floating point number, and therefore input was invalid.");
      }
      else
      {
         // input is a floating point number
         number = input.nextDouble();
         if (number > 0)
         {
            output = "positive";
         }
         else if (number < 0)
         {
            output = "negative";
         }
         else
         {
            output = "zero";
         }

         if (Math.abs(number) < SMALL_NUMBER)
         {
            output = output + " small";
         }
         else if (Math.abs(number) > LARGE_NUMBER)
         {
            output = output + " large";
         }

         System.out.println(output);
      }
   }
}

step 6 - provide input and output

step 7 - provide a class with a main method
