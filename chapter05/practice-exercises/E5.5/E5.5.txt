Write a program that reads a word, compares the first and second half of the word,
and prints “first and second half same” or “first and second half different”. If the
length of the word is odd, ignore the middle letter.

problem solving method (p.118 Big Java)

step 1 - understand the problem: what are the inputs? what are the desired outputs?
inputs:
1) a string
outputs:
1) a print statement that tells the user whether the first and second half of the word are the same.

step 2 - work out examples by hand
1)
in: anana
output: "first and second half different"
2)
in: quackquack
out: "first and second half same"
3)
in: mamma
out: "first and second half same"
4)
in: penelope
out: "first and second half different"

step 3 - write pseudocode for computing the answers to general instances of the problem based on the method you used to
solve specific instances of the problem in step 2.

even = ((wordLength % 2) == 0);
if (even)
   firstHalf = substring from character at position zero to character at position wordLength/2;
   secondHalf = substring from character at position wordLength/2 to end of string
else // word length is odd
   firstHalf = substring from character at position zero to character at position wordLength/2;
   secondHalf = substring from character at position wordLength/2 + 1 to end of string;
if (firstHalf equal secondHalf)
   print "first and second half same"
else
   print "first and second half different"

step 4 - declare the variables and constants that you need, and specify their types
String word
boolean even
String firstHalf
String secondHalf

step 5 - Turn the pseudocode into Java statements

step 6 - provide input and output

step 7 - provide a class with a main method // I do this at step 5 usually
