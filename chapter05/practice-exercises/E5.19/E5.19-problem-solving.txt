Write a program that reads in two floating-point numbers and tests whether they are
the same up to two decimal places. Here are two sample runs.
Enter two floating-point numbers: 2.0 1.99998
They are the same up to two decimal places.
Enter two floating-point numbers: 2.0 1.98999
They are different.

step 1 - understand the problem: What are the inputs and desired outputs?
inputs
1) first floating point number
2) second floating point number
outputs:
1) whether the two inputs are the same up to two decimal places

step 2 - work out examples by hand
1)
in: 1.999 2.0
out: They are the same up to two decimal places
2)
in: 1.989 2.0
out: They are different
3)
in: 1.9998 1.9992
out: They are the same up to two decimal places
4)
in: 2.0 1.99
out: They are different

step 3 - write a pseudocode algorithm for solving general instances of the problem
      using the method you used when solving specific instances of the problem by hand

if the absolute value of the difference between the two rounded inputs is less than
      epsilon (epsilon = 0.01, i.e., 1E-2) then the inputs are the same up to two
      decimal digits
   // then the floating point numbers are the same
   output "They are the same up to decimal places"
else
   output "They are different"

step 4 - declare the variables and constants that you need, and specify their type
double firstNumber
double secondNumber
final double EPSILON = 1E-14

step 5 - translate your pseudocode into Java language

step 6 - provide input and output
