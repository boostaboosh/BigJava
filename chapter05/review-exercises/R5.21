Explain how the lexicographic ordering of strings in Java differs from the ordering
of words in a dictionary or telephone book. Hint: Consider strings such as IBM, wiley.
com, Century 21, and While-U-Wait.

Lexicographic ordering of Strings in Java orders strings, i.e., sequences of characters, based on the position of each character in the Unicode character/symbol encoding which assigns numbers to characters.
Lexicographic ordering of strings in Java orders strings by comparing the Unicode position of characters at equivalent indexes in the compared strings, starting with the first character on the left.
So first Java compares the first letter of two words, then the second letter, then the third, and so on.
In the Unicode character encoding the space character comes before all printable characters, most but not all common punctuation marks come before letters and some come before and after numbers,
numbers are in order and come before letters of the English alphabet, capitalised letters come before uncapitalised letters, and letters are in order.

Lexicographic ordering of string differs from the ordering of words in a dictionary because it doesn't follow alphabetical order. Instead it follows the order of characters in their Unicode encoding.
This means that "Century 21" comes before "wiley.com" in lexicographic ordering.
