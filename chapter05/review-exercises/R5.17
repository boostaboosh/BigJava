algoritm R5.13:

If start1 > start2
   s = start1
Else
   s = start2
If end1 < end2
   e = endl
Else
   e = end2
If s < e
   The appointments overlap.
Else
   The appointments donâ€™t overlap.


Testing R5.17:
Develop a set of test cases for the algorithm in Exercise â€¢â€¢ R5.13.

There are two possibilites for the start time of medical appointments.
Either appointment 1 starts after appointment 2 or it does not.
There are two possibilities for the end time of medical appointments.
Either appointment 1 ends before appointment 2 or it does not.
There are for possible combinations of these possiblities which yield 4 test cases if we want to test every branch of the algorithm.
There are also boundary conditions like appointments that start and end at the same time.

Four possible test cases are:
1) appointment 1 starts after appointment 2 and ends before app 2: app1 20-22, app2 19-23
2) appointment 1 starts before appointment 2 and ends before app 2: app1 10-11, app2 13-14
3) appointment 1 starts after appointment 2 and ends after app2: app1 8-9, app2 4-7
4) appointment 1 starts before appointment 2 and ends after app 2: app1 7-13, app2 9-11

A boundary condition could be two appointments where one ends when the next begins:
b) app 1 starts at 13 and finishes at 14, and app 2 starts at 14 and ends at 15: app1 13-14, app2 14-15
