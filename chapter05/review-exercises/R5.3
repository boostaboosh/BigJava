Explain the difference between
	s = 0;
	if (x > 0) { s++; }
	if (y > 0) { s++; }
and
	s = 0;
	if (x > 0) { s++; }
	else if (y > 0) { s++; }

In the first example the variable s is incremented by one if x is greater than zero or if y is greater than zero.
In the second example s is incremented by one if x is greater than zero or if x is not greater than zero and y is greater than zero.
Practically speaking in the first example s could be incremented by one twice if both condtions are true, whereas in the second example 
s can only be incremented once. If the first condition is true, or if the first condition is false and the second condition is true.
