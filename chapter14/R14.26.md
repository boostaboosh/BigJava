## •• R14.26 

The radix sort algorithm sorts an array of n integers with d digits, using ten auxiliary
arrays. First place each value v into the auxiliary array whose index corresponds to
the last digit of v. Then move all values back into the original array, preserving their
order. Repeat the process, now using the next-to-last (tens) digit, then the hundreds
digit, and so on. What is the big-Oh time of this algorithm in terms of n and d? When
is this algorithm preferable to merge sort?

### walkthrough so I understand the algorithm:

[234, 123, 431, 123, 829, 539]
digits = 3

0 []
1 []
2 []
3 []
4 []
5 []
6 []
7 []
8 []
9 []

// 1st step
0 []
1 [431]
2 []
3 [123, 123]
4 [234]
5 []
6 []
7 []
8 []
9 [829, 539]

original = [431, 123, 123, 234, 829, 539]

// 2nd step
0 []
1 []
2 [123, 123, 829]
3 [431, 234, 539]
4 []
5 []
6 []
7 []
8 []
9 []

original = [123, 123, 829, 431, 234, 539]

// 3rd step
0 []
1 [123, 123]
2 [234]
3 []
4 [431]
5 [539]
6 []
7 []
8 [829]
9 []

original = [123, 123, 234, 431, 539, 829]


### What is the big-oh efficiency of this algorithm, the radix sort algorithm, in terms of number of values _n_, and number of digits _d_?

for each digit in the largest value from least significant (ones) to most significant (ones, tens, hundreds, and so on), each value in the array to be sorted is placed in the auxialliary array associated with that digit value, and then once each value has been placed, the values are replaced in the original array being sorted from smallest to largest for that digit.
So that's d * n * 2, or O(d * n).
Which means radix sort scales with O(d * n) efficiency relative to number of items and digits in the values being sorted.

### When is this algorithm preferable to merge sort?

Merge sort is O(n log(n)) compared to radix sort which is O(d * n) operation scaling relative to input size.
This means that radix sort is more efficient than merge sort when the number of digits _d_ is less than log(n), equally efficient when these values are equal, and less efficient when the number of digits is greater than log(n).
For example is sorting an array of 100 values, n = 100, log(n) = 6.644. So, radix sort will be quicker than merge sort if at most the values have 6 digits, but slower than merge sort if at most the values have 7 digits.
If sorting an array of 1,000,000 values, n = 1,000,000 and log(n) = 19.93. So radix sort will be quicker than merge sort if at most the values have 19 digits but slower than merge sort if at most the values have 20 digits.
