# ••• P14.2 

Sometimes, directory or file names have numbers in the middle, and there may be
more than one number, for example, sec3_14.txt or sec10_1.txt. Provide a compara-
tor that can compare such strings in a way that makes sense to humans. Break each
string into strings not containing digits and digit groups. Then compare two strings
by comparing the first non-digit groups as strings, the first digit groups as integers,
and so on.
