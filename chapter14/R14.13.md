â€¢ R14.13 Why does only one of the two while loops at the end of the merge method in
Section 14.4 do any work?

Because the two while loops at the end of the merge method in section 14.4 are part of the merge method in the merge sort algorithm which breaks the array in 2 parts, in half, and sorts each half recursively (by repeating the split in half process), and then merges each sorted half together using the merge algorithm in the merge function. 

When merging two sorted array together the merge method first sets an index counter for each sorted array aswell as one for the merged array that is being built, and then iterates over elemenets in both sorted arrays by accessing the i-th and j-th element in each, both starting at zero, and comparing them to see which is smaller (or bigger depending on how we want the resulting array to be sorted), and then assigning the k-th, also starting at zero, element in the merged array the value of the i-th or j-th element from the sorted arrays depending on which was smaller and then incrementing both i or j depending on which index's array had the smaller element, and k.

As elements are taken from the sorted arrays and put into the merged array, the index increases, and at some point all the elements from one of the arrays are in the merged array but the element's from the other array have not yet all been merged. This is inevitable because one of the arrays will finish being merged before the other seeing as the indexes for each sorted array are incremented separately as elements are found to be the next in the merged array.

As a result one of the two sorted arrays has elements whose index has not yet been traversed by its associated index counter. So only one of the loops at the end of the merge method will execute, because i < firstSortedArray.length or j < secondSortedArray.length will only be true for either the first or the second sorted arrays.
