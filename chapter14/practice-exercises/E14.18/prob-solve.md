••• R14.24 Consider the following speedup of the insertion sort algorithm of Special Topic 14.2.
For each element, use the enhanced binary search algorithm that yields the insertion
position for missing elements. Does this speedup have a significant impact on the
efficiency of the algorithm?

••• E14.18 Use insertion sort and the binary search from Exercise •• E14.16 to sort an array
as described in Exercise ••• R14.24. Implement this algorithm and measure its
performance.
