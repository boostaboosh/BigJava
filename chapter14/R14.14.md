â€¢ R14.14 A run is a sequence of adjacent repeated values (see Exercise R7.21). Describe an
O(n) algorithm to find the length of the longest run in an array. 

```
runLength = 1
previousVal = array[0]
for (index = 1, index < array.length, index++):
    currentVal = array[index]
    if (currentVal == previousVal):
        runLength++
    else:
        runLength = 1
```

This is an algorithm for finding the longest run length in an array. 
The operations relative to array size of this algorithm are of order... I'm not sure. Let's figure that out.

```
array[1] is 1 array access
then iterating over each element in the array is n array accesses. So O(n).
then a constant small number of operations is performed.
```

So, this algorithm for finding the longest run in an array is O(n).
