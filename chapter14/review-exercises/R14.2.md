â€¢ R14.2 How can you change the selection sort algorithm so that it sorts the elements in
descending order (that is, with the largest element at the beginning of the array)?

Instead of building up the sorted part of the array on the left hand side of the array and adding to it from left to right by selecting the smallest element in the unsorted tail, 
I can add elements to the sorted head of the array by selecting the largest element from the unsorted tail and moving it to its sorted position in the head for each index in the array.
This way the sorted array contains the elements in descending order.
