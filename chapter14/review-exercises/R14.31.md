Given an array of n integers and a value v, describe an O(n log(n)) algorithm to find whether there are two values x and y in the array with sum v.

### answer

#### inputs

array = [0, 5, 1, 4, 2, 3]
n = 6
v = 5

#### outputs

twoValsWithSum(v) == true

#### solving by hand

intuitively the first solution would be an algo which iterates over the array and check combinations with following items to see if there is a pair which adds up to v, breaking the loop and returning true if so. That would be n + n-1 + n-2 + n-3 + ... and so on array element comparisons in the worse case scenario where there is no pair which adds up to v. Which is a algo with O(n!) scaling efficiency relative to the number of elements in the array n, which is less efficient than the desired efficiency of O(n log(n)).

Immediately I wonder if sorting the array and using binary search for pairs which add up to v would help. I think so, because that would make it so that if the pair adds up to a value less than v, then you can cut your search space in half and not bother searching all pairs of the value of the current iteration and those that come before the value you just summed it with. This way you only have to performs a maximum of log(n) sums before knowing that no value in the array paired with the value of the current iteration adds up to v. 

woohoo, I found that solution pretty quickly.
in pseudocode this would like:

```
bool areTheirValsWithSum(sum, array)
  array.mergeSort()
  for (i = 0, i < array.length, i++)
    val = array[i]
    searchedVal = v - val
    from = i + 1
    sumPairFound = binarySearchFromIndex(array, searchedVal, from)
    if (sumPairFound)
      return true
  return false
  
bool binarySearchFromIndex(ascSortedArr, searchedVal, from)
  found = false
  to = ascSortedArr.length
  while !found
    mid = from + ((to - from) / 2)
    val = ascSortedArr[from + mid]
    if val == searchedVal
      return true
    else if (to - from) <= 0
      return false 
    else if val > searchedVal
      to = mid
    else if val < searchedVal
      from = mid
```
