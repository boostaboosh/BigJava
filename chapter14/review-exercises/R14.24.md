••• R14.24 Consider the following speedup of the insertion sort algorithm of Special Topic 14.2.
For each element, use the enhanced binary search algorithm that yields the insertion
position for missing elements. Does this speedup have a significant impact on the
efficiency of the algorithm?

oh, that is a good idea now that I understand it. Instead of an O(n) operation when placing the new unsorted element which is at the far right of the sorted part of the array, which involves iterating over each sorted element from right to left until one is not larger than the item to be inserted, I can instead perform a more efficient O(log(n)) binary search to find the correct position in the sorted array for the new element. This does appear to have a significant impact of the efficiency of the algorithm so far, because it now completes n * log(n) operations instead of n * n operations, but once the correct position of the new item is found, all the items to the right in the sorted part of the array need to be shifted to the right by 1 before the new element can be inserted, and this is an O(n) operation because every element from the new position to the right needs to be accessed and assigned to the index on the right, so this new insertion sort algorithm enhanced with binary search is O(n * (log(n) + n)) efficiency, which is still O(n**2) total efficiency, which is the same efficiency as the normal insertion sort algorithm.
