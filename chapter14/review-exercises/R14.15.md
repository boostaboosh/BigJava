•• R14.15 Consider the task of finding the most frequent element in an array of length n. Here
are three approaches:

a. Sort the array, then find the longest run.


b. Allocate an array of counters of the same size as the original array. For each
element, traverse the array and count how many other elements are equal to it,
updating its counter. Then find the maximum count.

c. Keep variables for the most frequent element that you have seen so far and its
frequency. For each index i, check whether a[i] occurs in a[0] ... a[i - 1]. If
not, count how often it occurs in a[i + 1] ... a[n - 1]. If a[i] is more frequent
than the most frequent element so far, update the variables.

Describe the big-Oh efficiency of each approach.
```
a.
sort the array using merge sort, O(n log(n))
find the longest run, O(n)

total big-oh efficiency: n log(n)


b.
create array of counters.
iterate over each element in the array accessing each element at each index, n operations so O(n):
    for each element traverse the array, so iterate over each element again and compare it to the elmement we are counting, n operations so O(n), and increment the count of the element we are counting before adding it to the array of counters in the same index as the element.
(the above loop is n operations that each do n operations, so that's n * n, or n**2 operations)
Find the maximum element in the counters array by comparing elements to a maximum value variable. that's counter.size, or n, operations, because we access each element at the index, and compare it to the max value.
Then access the element in the array at the same index as the max value in the counters array, 1 operation.

total big-oh efficiency: n**2


c. 
mostFrequent = a[0]             O(1)
frequencyOfMostFrequent = 0
for i = 0, i < a.length, i++:
    frequency = 1
    for j = 0, j < i, j++:
        if a[i] == a[j]:            O(n * n)
            frequency++
    if frequency > 0:
        for j = i + 1, j < a.length, j++:
            if a[i] == a[j]:                O(n * n)
                frequency++
    if frequency > frequencyOfMostFrequent:
        frequencyOfMostFrequent = frequency

total big-of efficiency: n**2
Because for each element in the array an algorithm which access each element in the array is executed, so n * n operations. That actually happens twice for each element in the array, so n*n + n*n operations roughly, which in big oh becomes 2 * n**2, and then n**2.
```
