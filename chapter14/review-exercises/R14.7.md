Suppose algorithm A takes five seconds to handle a data set of 1,000 records. If the
algorithm A is an O(n) algorithm, approximately how long will it take to handle a
data set of 2,000 records? Of 10,000 records?

algo A 5 seconds to handle 1,000 records
algo is an O(n) algorithm, which means the number of operations algo A performs increases linearly relative to the input size, in other words, when you increase the size of the data set by a certain multiplier, the number of operations the algorithm performs increases by the same multiplier. This is called a linear growth rate in the number of operations algo A performs relative to the size of the dataset it handles.
This means that the ratio (quotient) between the number of operations algo A performs for inputs of sizes 2 and 1 is 2, so twice as many operations for twice as many input elements. Better to assume for inputs of size 2000 and 1000 because big oh estimates are more accurate for larger input sizes.
So if algo A needs to handle a dataset of 2,000 records, it will take 10 seconds to do so, because we have multiplied the input size by 2 and so the processing time will also multiply by 2.
If algo A needs to handle a dataset of 10,000 records, so 10 times as many records, it will take 10 times as much time, so 10 times 5 seconds, which is 50 seconds to handle 10,000 records.
