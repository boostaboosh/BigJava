••• R14.23 Why does insertion sort perform significantly better than selection sort if an array is already sorted?

Because when an array is already sorted insertion sort has O(n) efficiency instead of O(n**2) efficiency because it iterates over each element in the array once, always grabbing the first left-most element from the unsorted part of the array, comparing it ONLY ONCE to the last element in the sorted part of the array (which is smaller than the element currently being placed which is following it seeing as the array is already sorted), and appends the new element to the sorted part of the array by leaving it in its original position seeing as it's already in the right position as the left most element of the unsorted part of the array which is now equivalent to the right most largest element in the sorted part of the array.
Whereas selection sort is always an O(n**2) algorithm because when building the sorted part of the array, selection sort selects the next element to append to the sorted part of the array by iterating over every single item in the unsorted part which is an O(n) operation repeated for every element, so O(n*n).
