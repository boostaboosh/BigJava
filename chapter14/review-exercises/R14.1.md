Sorting is the task of ordering items in a certain order for example numerical or alphabetical, by comparing them on a certain measure, for example value, size, lexicographic value, etc.
Different algorithms like selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort (pivot sort), and shell sort may be used.
Whereas seaching is the task of finding an item among a collection of items, which may or may not be sorted in a certain order.
If the collection is unsorted linear serach must be used, however different algorithms such as binary search may be used if the collection is sorted.
Sorting can help searching become more efficient, for example binary seach requires much less operations compared to linear search.
