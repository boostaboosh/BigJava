• R14.11 What is the big-Oh time estimate of the following method in terms of n, the length
of a? 

Use the “light bulb pattern” method of Section 14.7 to visualize your result.

public static void swap(int[] a)
{
 int i = 0;
 int j = a.length - 1;
 while (i < j)
 {
  int temp = a[i];
  a[i] = a[j];
  a[j] = temp;
  i++;
  j--;
 }
}

The big oh estimate for this algorithm's number of operations relative to input size is O(n), because the number of operations it performs is n / 2 seeing as it starts an index counter at zero and at the end of the array, and it increments the left side index and decrements the right side counter until the left side index is greater than the right side index. And it swaps the left side elements with the right side elements, so this algorithm reverses the order of the array.
