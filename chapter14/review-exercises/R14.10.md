â€¢ R14.10 What is the growth rate of the standard algorithm to find the minimum value of an
array? Of finding both the minimum and the maximum? 

The growth rate of the standard algorithm for finding the minimum or both the minimum value of an array is O(n), or linear.
So the number of operations performed increases by the same multiple the number of elements being searched increases.

This is because the standard algo for finding the minimum or maximum value of an array, is called linear or sequential search, assigns minimum or maximum variables the values of the first element in the array, and then iterates over each element in the array (hence named sequential search) starting with the second element, and compares each element to the current min and max variable values, replacing them if the current element is smaller or larger. The standard algorithm for finding the minimum and maximum values in an array works the same, and also goes through elements one at a time however has both maximum and minimum variables and compares elements in the array to both, checking if they are bigger than the max value or smaller than the min value, and replacing the relative value if so.

If you are dealing with an unsorted dataset, you have no other option but to search every single element in the unsorted sequence to find your value or check the minimum or maximum value. So you are limited to O(n) operations growth rate relative to input size search algorithms.
