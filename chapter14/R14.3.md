â€¢ R14.3 Suppose we modified the selection sort algorithm to start at the end of the array,
working toward the beginning. In each step, the current position is swapped with
the minimum. What is the result of this modification?

If you are using a version of the selection sort algorithm to sort an array but instead of sorting the unsorted array by starting with 
its left most element and swapping it with the smallest elements in the array, in order to start building the sorted array on the left side
of the array, you select the smallest element in the array still, but start with the last element in the array and swap it with the smallest element,
and keep descending down the indexes of the array, you end up forming an array sorted in descending order on the right side of the array, so as a result 
of this modification this version of the selection sort algorithm sorts the elements of an array is descending order instead of ascending order.
