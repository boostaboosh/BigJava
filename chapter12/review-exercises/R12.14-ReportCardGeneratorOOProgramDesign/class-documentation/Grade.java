    * Creates a grade object from a U.S.A. grade point average grade value.

    * The United States of America uses a Letter Grade Grade Point Average
    * grading scale which goes from 0.0 to 4.0, with 1.0 usually considered
    * the minimum passing grade for a course. 
    *
    * The numeric values in the US letter grade GPA system correspond to letters: 
    * - an A is a 4.0 grade, the highest score, 
    * - a B is a 3.0 grade, 
    * - a C is a 2.0 grade, 
    * - a D is a 1.0 grade, the passing grade, 
    * - and an F is a 0.0 grade. 
    * Sometimes the letter grades in the system use + and - symbols to represent
    * a value of 0.3 in the US GPA grading scale. 
    * So a B+ corresponds to a GPA of 3.3 and an A- corresponds to a GPA of 3.7.
    *
    * @param usaGradePointAverage the U.S.A. GPA grade value to create the grade from;
    *                    	  for example: 3.7. The U.S.A. GPA grade scale goes 
    * 				  from 0.0, the lowest grade, to 4.0, the highest grade
