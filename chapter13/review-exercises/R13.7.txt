â€¢ R13.7 Outline, but do not implement, a recursive solution 
for sorting an array of numbers.
Hint: First sort the subarray without the initial element.

A recursive solution solves a problem by using the solution
to the same problem with simpler inputs

inputs
array of numbers
e.g. 1, 2, 2, 1, 3
desired outputs
sorted array of numbers
e.g. 1, 1, 2, 2, 3

1. think of ways to simplify the inputs

a. i can remove the first elements
1, 2, 2, 1, 3 becomes 2, 2, 1, 3
b. i can remove first and last
1, 2, 2, 1, 3 becomes 2, 2, 1
c. i can cut it in half
1, 2, 2, 1, 3 becomes 1, 2, 2, and 1, 3

2. think of ways of combining solutions to the simpler inputs into
solutions to the problem with the original input, without worrying
about how the solutions to the problem with simpler inputs are 
obtained

a. if i have the solution for 2, 2, 1, 3 which is 1, 2, 2, 3;
how do i turn that solution into a solution to the problem with 
the original input 1, 2, 2, 1, 3?
I can iterate throught the array until i find an element less than
or equal to than the element i removed, and then place the element
i removed at that index

3. find solutions to the simplest inputs
if i keep removing the first element of an array I end up with
an array with 1 element, which is already sorted because it only
has 1 number.
if i have 2 elements in the array, i simply remove 1 and get the
solution to the array with 1 element.
