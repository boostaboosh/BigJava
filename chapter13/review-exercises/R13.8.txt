• R13.8 Write a recursive definition of x**n, where n ≥ 0, 
similar to the recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers. 
Hint: How do you compute x**n from x**n – 1? 
How does the recursion terminate?

inputs
x
n
desired output
x ** n

1. simplify inputs
decrement n

2. combine solutions to simpler inputs with removed part
x * x**n-1 == x**n

3. find solutions to the simplest inputs
if n == 0 return 1
or i could do if n == 1 return x
