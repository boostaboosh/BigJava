•• R13.6 Outline, but do not implement, a recursive solution for sorting an array of num bers.
Hint: First find the smallest value in the array.

A recursive solution solves a problem by using the solution
to the same problem with simpler inputs

inputs
array of numbers
e.g. 1, 2, 2, 1, 3
desired outputs
sorted array of numbers
e.g. 1, 1, 2, 2, 3

1. think of ways of simplifying the inputs

i can find the smallest value in the array
and remove it
so 1, 2, 2, 1, 3 becomes 2, 2, 1, 3

2. think of ways of combining the solution to the problem with the
simpler inputs with the part of the original input that i removed
to find a solution to the problem with the original inputs.
don't worry about how the solution to the problem with simpler
inputs is obtained.

so if i have the solution to the problem with inputs 2, 2, 1, 3
which is 1, 2, 2, 3 and i want to combine that solution with the
input i removed, the smallest number of the original input which
was 1, i can simply place the element i removed at the start of
the array, thereby obtaining the solution to the problem with the
original inputs: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3.

3. find solutions to the simplest inputs

if the input is an array with a single number then the smallest 
number in the array is the single number itself.
if the input is an array with 2 number i remove the smallest number
and find the solution for the array with a single number.
