Use recursion to implement a method

public static boolean find(String text, String str)

that tests whether a given text contains a string.

For example, find("Mississippi", "sip") returns true.

Hint: If the text starts with the string you want to match, then you are done. If not,
consider the text that you obtain by removing the first character.


input
text: "this is some text."
sting: "some"
desired outputs
true if the text contains the string
