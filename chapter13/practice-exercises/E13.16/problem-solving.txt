Implement a SubsetGenerator that generates all subsets of the characters of a string.

For example, the subsets of the characters of the string "rum" are the eight strings

"rum", "ru", "rm", "r", "um", "u", "m", ""

Note that the subsets don’t have to be substrings—for example, "rm" isn’t a substring
of "rum".

step 1
understand the problem
input:
string
output:
all subsets (not necessarily substrings)

step 2
solve the problem by hand
input:
"pin"
output:
"pin", "pi", "pn", "p", "i", "in", "n", "",

step 3
write a (recursive) pseudocode algorithm for solving generic instances of the problem using the method I used to solve
specific versions of the problem by hand

step 3a
ways to simplify the inputs:
remove the first or last character, so "pin" becomes "in"
remove the both first and last chars, so "pin" becomes "i"

step 3b
ways to combine solutions to simpler inputs with removed inputs to obtain solution to original input
"p" with solution for "in":
If I have all subsets of "in" and I want to obtain all subsets of "pin" I can prepend p to each subset of "in"
to obtain all the subsets of pin.

step 3c
find the solution for the simplest inputs
The subsets of an empty string are itself.

step 3d
implement a solution algorithm by combining the solutions for the simplest inputs
with the reduction (simplification and combination) step.
