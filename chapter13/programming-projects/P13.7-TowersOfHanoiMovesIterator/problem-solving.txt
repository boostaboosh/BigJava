P13.7

Implement at iterator that produces the moves for the Towers of Hanoi puzzle described in Worked Example 13.2.
Provide methods hasMoreMoves and nextMove. The nextMove method should yield a string describing the next move.

For example, the following code prints all moves needed to move five desks from peg 1 to peg 3:

DiskMover mover = new DiskMover(5, 1, 3);
while (mover.hasMoreMoves())
{
    System.out.println(mover.nextMove())
}

Hint: A disk mover that moves a single disk from one peg to another simply has a nextMove method that returns a
string:
    "Move disk from peg source to target"

A disk mover with more than one disk to move must work harder. It needs another DiskMover to help it move the first d-1
disks. Then nextMove asks that disk mover for its next move until it is done. Then the nextMove method issues a command
to move the d-th disk. Finally, it constructs another disk mover that generates the remaining moves.

It helps to keep track of the state of the disk mover:
 - BEFORE_LARGEST: A helper mover moves the smaller pile to the other peg.
 - LARGEST: Move the largest disk from the source to the destination.
 - AFTER_LARGEST: The helper mover moves the smaller pile from the other peg to the target.
 - DONE: All moves are done.
