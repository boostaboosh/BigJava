Use the following recursive approach to check whether you can escape from the
maze: If you are at an exit, return true. Recursively check whether you can escape
from one of the empty neighboring locations without visiting the current location.
This method merely tests whether there is a path out of the maze. Extra credit if you
can print out a path that leads to an exit.

•• P13.10
Using the PartialSolution interface and solve method from Exercise •• E13.23,
provide a class MazePartialSolution for solving the maze escape problem of Exercise ••• P13.8.

•• E13.23
The backtracking algorithm will work for any problem whose partial solutions can
be examined and extended. Provide a PartialSolution interface type with methods
examine and extend, a solve method that works with this interface type, and a class
EightQueensPartialSolution that implements the interface.
