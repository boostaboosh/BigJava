Write methods
public static double perimeter(Ellipse2D.Double e);
public static double area(Ellipse2D.Double e);
that compute the area and the perimeter of the ellipse e. Add these methods to a class
Geometry. The challenging part of this assignment is to find and implement an accurate
formula for the perimeter. Why does it make sense to use a static method in this case?

It makes sense to use a static method to compute and return the perimeter and area of
ellipse objects because these two operations do not require information about a Geometry 
object's internal state to execute, instead they solely rely on the parameters passed to
them in order to computer the perimeter and area values of the ellipse. So, they do not
need to instantiate an instance of the Geometry class to execute.
