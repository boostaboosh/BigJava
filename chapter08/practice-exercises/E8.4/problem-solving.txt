•• E8.4
As pointed out in Section 8.2.3, the Scanner.next method is a mutator that returns a
value. Implement a class Reader that reads from System.in and does not suffer from
that shortcoming. Provide methods

public boolean hasMoreElements() // Checks whether there is another element
public String getCurrent() // Yields the current element without consuming it
public void next() // Consumes the current element

problem solving:

So, the Scanner class takes system.in as a constructor arguments and reads from it.
System.in is the standard input stream and is a public static final variable of 
type InputStream in the System class.
