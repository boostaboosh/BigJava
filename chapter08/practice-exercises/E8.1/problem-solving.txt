•• E8.1
Implement the Coin class described in Section 8.2.

Modify the CashRegister class so that coins can be added to the cash register,
by supplying a method:

void receivePayment(int coinCount, Coin coinType)

The caller needs to invoke this method multiple times, once for each type of coin
that is present in the payment.

coin class implementation
steps
1 - list of methods I need to supply
a method which gets the value of a coin
2 - specify the public interface
2a) sample object use to get an idea of public interface
Coin quarter = new Coin(0.25)
double value = quarter.getValue();
2b) the public interface in Coin.java file
3 - document the public interface
4 - determine instance variables (if a value can be computed on demand do so
5 - implement constructors and methods
6 - test the class (using JUnit unit test framework, which verifies that a unit, i.e., class,
                    works correctly in isolation)
