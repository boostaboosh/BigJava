You need to write a program for DNA analysis that checks whether a substring of
one string is contained in another string. What simpler problem can you solve first?

It's easier to solve a complex problem if I break it 
down into a series of tasks, each a simple extension of
the previous task, starting with a simple problem and
ending with the original complex problem.

If my task is to write a program that checks whether a
substring of one string is contained in another string,
a simple task I could attempt first is to check if a
single character in one string is also a character in 
another string.
