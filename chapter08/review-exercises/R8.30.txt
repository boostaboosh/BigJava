â€¢ R8.30 
Suppose your homework assignments are located in the directory 
/home/me/cs101 (c:\Users\Me\cs101 on Windows). 
Your instructor tells you to place your homework into packages. 
In which directory do you place the class hw1.problem1.TicTacToeTester?

I must place the class hw1.problem1.TicTacToeTester in the directory:
/home/me/cs101/hw1/problem1/
because the directory path of a class must match its package name.

A source file must be located in a directory that matches the package name. 
The parts of the name between periods in a package specification statement, 
such as:
package hw1.problem1.TicTacToeTester
represent successively nested directories.
So, a class called TicTacToeTester inside the package hw1.problem1 must be 
located in the directory /hw1/problem1
