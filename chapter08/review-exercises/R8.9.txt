On which classes does the class Integer in the standard library depend?

To see what classes the class Integer in the standard library depends
on I need to look at the Java API documentation and look at what 
classes the Integer class uses. If it uses another class, it depends on
that class to function.

So, I'm going to look through the constructors and methods and see what
type of arguments they take, and if any of the arguments or return 
values are objects of a different class type than Integer.

Looking through the constructor and method dependencies of the Integer
class I can see that it depends on the classes:
String
Object
CharSequence
