What side effect, if any, do the following three methods have?

public class Coin
{
 . . .
 public void print()
 {
 System.out.println(name + " " + value);
 }

 public void print(PrintStream stream)
 {
 stream.println(name + " " + value);
 }

 public String toString()
 {
 return name + " " + value;
 }
}

The print() method has a side effect on the out instance variable of the System class which is
an object of the PrintStream class.

The print(PrintStream stream) method has a side effect on the stream object of the PrintStream
class passed to it as an argument. Because it changes the state of the parameter variable stream
passed to it as an argument.

The toString() method does not have any side effects because it does not change the state of the
implicit parameter on which it is invoked (a Coin object), and it does not change the state of 
any other objects inside of its body.
