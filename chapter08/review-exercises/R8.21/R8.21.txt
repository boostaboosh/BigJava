Draw a memory diagram that shows why the following method can’t swap two
BankAccount objects:

public static void falseSwap(BankAccount a, BankAccount b)
{
 BankAccount temp = a;
 a = b;
 b = temp;
}

public class SwapAccounts
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    BankAccount mumAccount = new BankAccount(1000);
    BankAccount kidAccount = new BankAccount(20);
    falseSwap(mumAccount, kidAccount);
  }

  public static void falseSwap(BankAccount a, BankAccount b)
  {
    BankAccount temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
  }
}

So, why doesn't this work?
Because this doesn't swap the argument variables local to the main method's values,
that's impossible seeing as Java is pass by copied value. Instead, this just 
assigns new values to the parameter variables a and b after they have been 
initialised with the values of the arguments passed to the methods which were 
references to the mumAccount and kidAccount objects.

Now, I need to draw a memory diagram to show why this method doesn't work because it
cannot swap two bank account objects.
