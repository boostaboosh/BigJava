•• R8.19 
Consider the following method that is intended to swap the values of two integers:

public static void falseSwap(int a, int b)
{
 int temp = a;
 a = b;
 b = temp;
}

public static void main(String[] args)
{
 int x = 3;
 int y = 4;
 falseSwap(x, y);
 System.out.println(x + " " + y);
}

Why doesn’t the method swap the contents of x and y?

In short, because Java passes arguments to method parameters by value, and not by 
reference.
So, when the falseSwap method is invoked from the main method with the arguments
x and y, the values contained in the variables x and y are copied and assigned to
falseSwap method's parameter variables also called x and y. But, the variables
x and y inside of the falseSwap method body are not the same variables as the x
and y in the main method. Which means that any manipulation of their contents in
the falseSwap method has no effect on the contents of the x and y variables in the
main method.
