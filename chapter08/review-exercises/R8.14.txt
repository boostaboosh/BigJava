â€¢ R8.14 Which of the following classes are immutable?
a. Rectangle
b. String
c. Random

An immutable class is a class with no mutator methods.
What this means is that objects of an immutable class always have the same internal
data representation, i.e., instance variables, as when they were first created and
cannot be mutated, but only accessed.

immutable:
String

mutable:
Rectangle
Random

String objects have no mutator methods. Rectangle objects can have their size and
coordinates changed. Random objects which generate random numbers can have their
state changed by the next methods because they change the next value that the Random
object will return when calling the same method, so these are mutator methods.
