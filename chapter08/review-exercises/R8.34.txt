What is the default package? 
Have you used it before this chapter in your programming? 

The default package is a special package, i.e., grouping of related classes, in Java
which has no name.
The default package is the package in which classes that I've written in my Java 
program are placed if I do not specify the package in which to place my class at the
top of the source file with the package specification statement:
package packageName;
for example:
package com.horstmann.bigjava;

If I don't place a package specification statement at the top of my Java class source
file as the first instruction in the source file, the class is placed into the a 
nameless package known as the default package.
