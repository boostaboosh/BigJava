Suppose you are asked to find all words in which no 
letter is repeated from a list of words. What simpler 
problem could you try first?

When developing a solution to a complex problem it is 
easier to first solve a simpler task.
It is easiest to solve if I make a series of tasks, each
a simple extension of the previous task, starting with 
and easy task and ending with the original problem.

If my task is to find all words in which no letter is
repeated from a list of words, a simpler problem I could
try first is to find out if any letter is repeated in a
single word. An even simpler problem is to find out if a
single letter is repeated in a single word. An even 
simpler problem is to find out if the first letter of a 
word is the same as its second letter.
