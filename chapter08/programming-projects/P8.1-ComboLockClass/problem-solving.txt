••• P8.1 
Declare a class ComboLock that works like the combination lock
in a gym locker, as shown here. 
The lock is constructed with a combination: 
three numbers between 0 and 39. 

The reset method resets the dial so that it points to 0. 

The 
turnLeft and
turnRight 
methods turn the dial by a given number of ticks to the left or right. 

The open method attempts to open the lock. 
The lock opens if the user first turned the dial to the right to the first number in the combination, 
then left to the second, 
and then right to the third.

public class ComboLock
{
 . . .
 public ComboLock(int secret1, int secret2, int secret3) { . . . }
 public void reset() { . . . }
 public void turnLeft(int ticks) { . . . }
 public void turnRight(int ticks) { . . . }
 public boolean open() { . . . }
}

I realise now that I might need a ComboLockEntry class to keep track of an entry value and direction.
I might need to change my turn right and left methods so that an entry is only recorded if the dial is turned
in a different direction the next go. But if it's the final turn that is not necessary and the lock should open.
