Design a class Cannonball to model a cannonball that is fired into the air. 
A ball has
• An x- and a y-position.
• An x- and a y-velocity.
Supply the following methods:
• A constructor with an x-position (the y-position is initially 0).
• A method move(double deltaSec) that moves the ball to the next position. 
First compute the distance traveled in deltaSec seconds, using the current velocities,
then update the x- and y-positions; then update the y-velocity by taking into
account the gravitational acceleration of –9.81 m/seconds squared; the x-velocity is
unchanged.
• A method Point getLocation() that gets the current location of the cannonball,
rounded to integer coordinates.
• A method ArrayList<Point> shoot(double alpha, double v, double deltaSec) whose
arguments are the angle α (alpha) and initial velocity v. (Compute the x-velocity as v
cos α (alpha) and the y-velocity as v sin α (alpha); then keep calling move with the given time
interval until the y-position is 0; return an array list of locations after each call
to move.)

Use this class in a program that prompts the user for the starting angle and the initial
velocity. Then call shoot and print the locations.
