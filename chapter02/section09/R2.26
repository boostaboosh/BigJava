Graphics R2.26 
Why does the argument of the paintComponent method have type Graphics and not Graphics2D ?

The paintComponent method of the JComponent class receives a Graphics object as its argument.
The Graphics objects stores the graphics state: the current color, font, and so on.
When Java application programmers clamored for a more object-oriented approach the Java system programmers created the Graphics2D class, which extends the Graphics class.
When the Swing toolkit calls the paintComponent method, it actually passes an object of type Graphics2D as the argument.
Because we want to use the more sophisticated methods to draw two-dimensional graphics objects we need to use the Graphics2D class. This is accomplished by using a cast.
