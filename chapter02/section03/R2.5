What is the public interface of a class? How does it differ from the implementation of
a class?


The public interface of a class is the description of what you can make objects of that class do, i.e., what the methods of a class do but not how they do it.
Whereas the private implementation of a class is the description of how the objects of that class do what they can do and how they store their information, 
i.e., what instructions make the methods of that class do what they do, and how objects of that class organise their information internally.
