Explain the difference between an object and a class.


A class describes a set of objects with the same behaviour, i.e., a light bulb class describes a set of light bulb objects.
A class contains declarations of methods which define the behaviour of an object of that class.
An object is a complex data item.
Objects belong to classes depending on their behaviour. A water heater object belongs to a water heater class because its behaviour is like that of other water heaters which is described by the methods in the water heater class, for example: "heat water".

A method is a sequence of instructions that describe how to carry out a particular task, and that can access the data of an object.
We use methods to control the way an object behaves.
