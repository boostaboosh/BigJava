Some light bulbs use a glowing filament, others use a fluorescent gas. If you consider
a light bulb a Java object with an “illuminate” method, would you need to know
which kind of bulb it is?

If we consider a light bulb as a Java object with an "illuminate" method we don't need to know whether the light uses a glowing filament or a flourescent gas to illumate the bulb.
A method is a sequence of instructions that fulfill a particular task, and that can interact with the data of an object.
When we use a method to manipulate the behaviour of an object we do NOT need to know how the method is implemented, i.e., what the instructions inside the method are, or how the object itself is organised internally.
The behaviour of the method is well defined, and that is what matters to us when we use it. In this case the "illuminate" method illumates a light bulb object. It does not matter to us what the instructions of the "illuminate" method are or how the light bulb is made. The output, i.e., behaviour, of the light bulb is the same when the "illuminate" method is invoked: the light bulb object illuminates.
