R2.1

In Java, objects are grouped into classes according to their behavior. 
Would a window object and a water heater object belong to the same class or to different classes?
Why?

A window object and water heater object belong to different classes because they have different behaviours.

Classes describe sets of objects with the same behaviour.
The behaviour of a water heater does not match that of a window.

All objects of the same class can have the same methods invoked on them. 
Methods allow programmers to manipulate an object, i.e., cotrol the way it behaves.
A method is a sequence of instructions that fulfull a particular task, and can access the data of an object.
A method that can be invoked on a water heater object, for example: "get hot water", cannot be invoked on a window.
You cannot make a window behave the way a water heater does, or vice-versa.
