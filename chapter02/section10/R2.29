Graphics R2.29 How do you specify a text color?


You specify a text color by changing the color of the of the Graphics2D object you're using to draw shapes and strings.
After you've specified the color of the Graphics2D object which stores a graphics state (color, font, etc.) that you want to color text with, you can draw a string with the drawString method of the Graphics2D class.
This is done with the setColor(color) method of the graphics2D class which receives an object of type Color as its argument.
Objects of type color use the RGB color model, which specifies a color by the amount of primary colors (red, green, blue) that they contain. The amounts given are integers between 0 and 255 (maximum amount present).
