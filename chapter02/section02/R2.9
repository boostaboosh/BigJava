Explain the difference between the = symbol in Java and in mathematics.


In Java the = symbol is an assignment operator which assigns the value to its right to the variable on its left.
In mathematics the = symbol is an equality operator which says that the values to each of its sides are equal to each other.

So, in Java the = symbol denotes an ACTION, it is an operator which replaces the value of a variable.
On the other hand, in mathematics the = symbol denotes a STATEMENT about equality.
