• R20.2 What is the advantage of a layout manager over telling the container “place this component at position (x, y)”? 

With a layout manager, the components are arranged next to each other for us, without us having 
to calculate which position each component is in.
Furthermore, a layout manager tells the container how we want the components to be arranged 
relative to each other, so the relative position of components on the screen is maintained even
when the application window is resized or changes shape.
