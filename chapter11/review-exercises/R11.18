Which exceptions can the next and nextInt methods of the Scanner class throw? 
Are they checked exceptions or unchecked exceptions?

The next method of the Scanner class can throw the following 2 exceptions:
NoSuchElementException - if no more tokens are available
IllegalStateException - if this scanner is closed

And the nextInt method of the Scanner class can throw the following 3 exceptions:
InputMismatchException - if the next token does not match the Integer regular expression, or is out of range
NoSuchElementException - if input is exhausted
IllegalStateException - if this scanner is closed

NoSuchElementException and InputMismatchException are both exceptions imported from the java.util 
package which inherit from the RuntimeException class and are therefore unchecked exceptions, 
which the programmer can avoid from being generated by not making mistakes in the instructions 
they give to the computer.
IllegalStateException also extends Runtime Exception and so is an unchecked exception which the
programmer is responsible for avoiding.
