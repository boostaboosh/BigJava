•• R11.20 
Can the readFile method in Section 11.5 throw a NullPointerException? If so, how?

Yes, it can throw a NullPointerException if the parameter of the File class constructor
is a String with a null value instead of a pathname.'

The NullPointerException class extends runtime exception and is therefore an unchecked
exception, so the readFile method doesn't need to handle this exception by throwing it 
or catching it.
