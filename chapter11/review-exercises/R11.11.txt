Why donâ€™t you need to declare that your method might throw an IndexOutOfBounds-
Exception?

Because an IndexOutOfBounds exception is an unchecked exception which means the compiler
does not complain if a method that might throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException doesn't 
handle such an exception either by throwing it or catching it and handling it some other way.

Unchecked exceptions are my (the programmer's) fault. The compiler does
not check whether you handle an unchecked exception, such as an IndexOutOfBounds-
Exception. After all, you should check your index values rather than install a handler
for that exception.

Checked exceptions on the other hand might occur no matter how careful I the programmer
am, and so the compiler asks me to specify what to do should they occur, because they 
might in fact occur.
