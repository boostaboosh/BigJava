• R11.2 
Suppose you wanted to add the total to an existing file instead of writing a new file.
Exercise • R11.1 indicates that you cannot simply do this by specifying the same file
for input and output. How can you achieve this task? Provide the pseudocode for
the solution.

understand the problem:
input: a file with numbers
output: add the total of the numbers to an existing file without overwriting the existing file's contents

solve the problem by hand
existing.txt
I exist

existing.txt
I exist 
1
2
3
total: 6

write pseudocode for solving the problem

prompt user for input and existing output file names
create file from input file name
create scanner which produces values from the input file

// now I need to get the existing file and add the total to the existing file and its contents
create file from output file name
create scanner which produces values from the output file

// copy content from existing output file to temporary file
create a print writer which writes to a new file called temporary.txt
while there are more lines in the output file:
	read line from the output file
	write line to the temporary output file

// compute total of numbers in input file and write numbers to temporary file
total = 0
while there are numbers in the input file scanner:
	read the input file numbers one number at a time
	write number and new line to temporary output file
	total = total + number

// write total to temporary file
write total to the temporary output file

// copy content from temporary file back to existing output file
create a print writer which writes to the existing output file // empties the output file
while there are more lines in the temporary output file:
	read line from temporary output file
	write line from temporary output file to the existing output file using the print writer

// close all scanners from and writers to files to ensure all output is written to the disk file
// close input file scanner
close input file scanner
// close existing output file scanner and print writer
close existing output file scanner
close existing output file print writer
// close temporary output file scanner and print writer
close temporary output file scanner
close temporary output file print writer
