•• R11.19 
Suppose the program in Section 11.5 reads a file containing the following values:
1
2
3
4
What is the outcome? How could the program be improved to give a more accurate
error report?

The outcome would be that a BadDataException is generated with the message "End of file expected"
because the first number in the file should be the number of data values to read from the file, 
so there should be just one value to read, but instead there are 3, so after reading the value 2
the program checks if there is a next token in the scanner, which there is, and throws the
BadDataException with the message "End of file expected".
The integer values are actually read correctly by the nextDouble method of the scanner class which 
reads an integer and interprets it as a double, so 2 become 2.0 for example.

To give a more accurate error report the message could be changed to say the number of values
expected based on the first line of input, something like:

throw new BadDataException("Expected number of values as indicated on 1st line was " + numberOfValues
		+ ", however after reading " + numberOfValues + " values there were still values "
		+ "remaining in the input file."
