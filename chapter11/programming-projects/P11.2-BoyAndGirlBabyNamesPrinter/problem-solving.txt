••• P11.2
Write a program that reads a file in the same format as worked_example_1/babynames.txt
and prints all names that are both boy and girl names (such as Alexis or Morgan).

step 1) understand the problem
what are the given inputs?
a text file with 1000 lines each in the format:
4  Joshua  328955  1.6022  Sarah  224000  1.1413
where:
the first number is the popularity rank of the names on the rank
the first word is the boy name with the associated popularity rank (4)
the second number is the frequency of that boy's name for a given decade (328955)
the third number is the percentage of baby boy's given that name for the given decade (1.6022%)
the second word is the girl name with the associated popularity rank (4)
the fourth number is the frequency of that girl's name for a given decade (224000)
the fifth number is the percentage of baby girl's given that name for the given decade (1.1413%)
what's the desired output?
a print out of all the names in babynames.txt text file that are both boy and girl names.

step 2) solve examples of the problem by hand
inputs:
1  Elijah  462085  2.2506  Mary  302962  1.5436
2  Christopher  361250  1.7595  Ashley  301702  1.5372
3  Ashley  351477  1.7119  Elijah  237133  1.2082
outputs:
Elijah
Ashley

step 3) write pseudocode for solving general instances of the problem I solved specific examples of by hand
pseudocode:
open a reader on babynames.txt file
for each line in babynames
    add boy name to list of boy's names
    add girl name to list of girl's names
for each name in boy's names
    if name is in girl's names
        print name
