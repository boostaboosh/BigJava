    <p>I grew up in Northern Germany and attended the <a href='http://www.uni-kiel.de/'>Christian-Albrechts-Universität</a> in <a href='http://www.kiel.de/'>Kiel</a>, a harbor town at the Baltic sea. I received a M.S. in computer science from <a href='http://www.syr.edu/'>Syracuse University</a>, and a Ph.D. in mathematics from the <a href='http://www.umich.edu/'>University of Michigan</a> in Ann Arbor. I taught computer science at <a href='http://sjsu.edu/'>San Jose State University</a> for almost thirty years and held visiting appointments at universities in Germany, Switzerland, Vietnam, and Macau. I was a “serial entrepreneur” before that was a thing, including a stint as VP and CTO of a dot com startup that went from three people in a tiny office to a public company. In my copious spare time I write books and develop online courses for beginning and professional programmers.</p>
