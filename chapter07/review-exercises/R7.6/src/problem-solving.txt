Write a loop that fills an array values with ten random numbers
between 1 and 100.
Write code for two nested loops that fill values with ten different
random numbers between 1 and 100.

step 1 - understand the problem
inputs: none. Just use a loop for the first array, and a nested loop for
        the second one.
outputs: 2 outputs:
 - output 1: an array of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100
 - output 2: an array of 10 different random numbers between 1 and 100

step 2 - solving instances of the problem by hand
output 1:
        8, 2, 0, 67, 23, 58, 58, 10, 98, 73
output 2:
        23, 19, 93, 57, 83, 92, 2, 99, 37, 92

step 3 - write pseudocode for solving the problem
pseudocode algorithm "hey computer, follow these orders":
create an array of length 10
create a random number generator
get the next random number from the generator between 1 and 100
input the random number into the array
get the next random number from the generator between 1 and 100
input the random number into the array
... basically repeat this 10 times, so we want a loop.
the first output seems relatively simple.
decide the steps to repeat:
get the next random number from the generator between 1 and 100
put the random number into the array
looping condition? When to repeat?
until the array is full, i.e., all its elements have been used
while index < array.size
determine loop type
count controlled because we repeat increment index until it
reaches a value equal to array size - 1
create an array of length 10
create a random number generator
for (int index = 0; index < array.size; index++)
    get next random number from generator
    array[index] = next random number from generator

what about the other loop? Well the other 3 loops: the 2 nested loops?
output 2?
Okay, for output 2 we want to put random numbers into the array,
but this time we want to check if the number already exists in the
array before we add it, if it does, we need to get a different
random number and try again until the array of length 10 is full.
so, let's begin:
pseudocode for two nested loops that fill an array with 10 different
random values. "Hey computer, follow these orders":
create an array of length 10
get a random number between 1 and 100
if that number is already in the array
    get a different number
if that number is already in the array
    get a different random number
... this is a loop
repeat:
    if that number is already in the array
        get a different random number
loop condition
    if the random number is already in the array
loop type
    event controlled
    while random number is already in the array
        get a different random number
...back to our pseudocode
create an array of length 10
get a random number between 1 and 100
while random number is already in the array
    get a different random number
put random number in the array
get a random number between 1 and 100
while random number is already in the array
    get a different random number
put random number in the array
...repeat until array is full: that do be a loop
repeat:
    get a random number between 1 and 100
    while random number is already in the array
        get a different random number
    put random number in the array
looping condition:
    repeat the loop until the array is full
loop type
    count controlled because array element index is incremented by one
    until it reaches array length - 1
    pseudocode loop:
    for array element from index 0 to length - 1
        get a random number between 1 and 100
        while random number is already in the array
            get a different random number
        put random number in the array

Alright this seems relatively simple buuuut, how do we figure out
if a number is already in the array?
Ah, we use the basic looping algorithm for searching an array
for a value: the linear search! amen
get a random number between 1 and 100
while random number is already in the array
    get a different random number
becomes:
get a random number between 1 and 100
alreadyInArray = true
while alreadyInArray == true
    searchedValue = random number
    alreadyInArray = false
    for each element in the array
        if element == searchedValue
            alreadyInArray = true
    if alreadyInArray == true
        random number = get a different random number
    else
        put random number in the array

so our pseudocode for obtaining output 2 actually becomes:
create an array of length 10
for array element from index 0 to length - 1
    get a random number between 1 and 100
    alreadyInArray = true
    while alreadyInArray == true
        searchedValue = random number
        alreadyInArray = false
        for each element in the array
            if element == searchedValue
                alreadyInArray = true
        if alreadyInArray == true
            random number = get a different random number
        else
            put random number in the array

alrighty, step 4: let's translate all this pseudocode to java code!
