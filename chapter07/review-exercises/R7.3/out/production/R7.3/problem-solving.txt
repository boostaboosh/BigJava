Write code that fills an array values with each set of numbers below.
a. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
b. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
c. 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100
d. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
e. 1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11
f. 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
g. 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4

part b problem-solving
assign array[0] a value of 0
assign array[1] a value of 2
assign array[2] a value of 4
assign array[i] a value of i * 2

part c problem-solving
these are squares from 1 to 10

part e problem solving
Contains a program that fills an array values with each set of numbers
below:
1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11
First 4 numbers are squares from 1 to 4. Then we have 9, then 7 is a prime.
Then 4 and 9. then 1 which is a prime.
What are the inputs? None
What are the outputs? An array of 9 values: 1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11
Solve examples of the problem by hand:
1, 4, 9, 16, 9, 7, 4, 9, 11
Write pseudocode for solving the problem:
add 1 to the array
add 4 to the array
add 9 to the array
add 16 to the array
add 9 to the array
add 7 to the array
add 4 to the array
add 9 to the array
add 11 to the array
inside the loop:
add counter * counter to the array
increment counter by 1
loop condition:
counter <= 4
loop type: count controlled (counter)
loop:
for (int counter = 1; counter <= 4; counter++)
    array[counter - 1] = counter * counter
