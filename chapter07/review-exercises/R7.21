R7.21

A run is a sequence of adjacent repeated values. Give pseudocode for computing the
length of the longest run in an array. For example, the longest run in the array with
elements

1 2 5 5 3 1 2 4 3 2 2 2 2 3 6 5 5 6 3 1

has length 4 (2 2 2 2).


Computation problem solving

Step 1 - understand the problem
Inputs: array of integers
Outputs: the length of the longest sequence of identical integers in the array

Step 2 - solve an example of the problem by hand
1 9 3 2 3 3 3 9 3 8 8 8 2 2 9 0
Here there are two sequences of length 3. So, the longest sequence in the array
has length 3.

Step 3 - write pseudocode for solving the problem

longestSequenceLength = 0
sequenceLength = 0
For (index = 1; index < array.length; index++)
	value = array[index]
	previousValue = array[index - 1]
	if value == previousValue
		sequenceLength = sequenceLength + 1
	else
		sequenceLength = 1
	if sequenceLength > longestSequenceLength
		longestSequenceLength = sequenceLength
