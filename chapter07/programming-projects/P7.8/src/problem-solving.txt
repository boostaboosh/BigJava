•• P7.8
A theater seating chart is implemented as a two-dimensional array of ticket prices,
like this:

10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
10 10 20 20 20 20 20 20 10 10
10 10 20 20 20 20 20 20 10 10
10 10 20 20 20 20 20 20 10 10
20 20 30 30 40 40 30 30 20 20
20 30 30 40 50 50 40 30 30 20
30 40 50 50 50 50 50 50 40 30

Write a program that prompts users to pick either a seat or a price.
Mark sold seats by changing the price to 0.
When a user specifies a seat, make sure it is available.
When a user specifies a price, find any seat with that price.

problem-solving:

step 1: understand the problem:

What are the inputs?
The user inputs a seat, i.e., a row and a column,
or the user inputs a price

What are the desired outputs?
If the user inputs a seat, the program should check if that seat is available.
If the user inputs a price, the program should find any seat with that price.

step 2: solve an example of the problem by hand:
10 10 10 10
10 20 20 10
20 30 30 20
30 40 40 30

input: seat with price 10
output: seat with price 10 at row 1 column 1.

input: seat at row 4 and column 3
output: seat at row 4 and column 3 is available.

step 3: write pseudocode for solving general instances of the problem I just solved specific
examples of

create a theatre object which has the seat price and the seat availability
ask the user to pick a seat or a price (s/p)
if the user wants to pick a seat
    ask the user which seat they want to pick
    get availability of the seat the user picked
    print out the availability of the seat the user picked
else if the user wants to pick a price
    ask the user what price they want to pay for a seat
    get a seat of that price
    print out a seat, i.e., row and column, of that price

one thing I've realised is that the theatre object doesn't need to contain
two 2D array of seat prices and availability. Instead, I can create a seat
object with price and availability, and even rows and column. And then, the
theatre seating chart only needs to be an array of seat objects, or a 2D array
of seat objects which all have a price and availability.

public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      /*
      create a theatre
      print the theatre layout
      prompt the user
      ... let me try this again using a sample object.
       */

       Theatre theatre = new Theatre();
       theatre.printLayout();

       Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
       System.out.print("Do you want to pick a seat or a price? (s/p) ")
       answer = scanner.next();
       if answer == s
       ... I'm going to keep doing this in the actual TheatreSeatPicker class.
   }
