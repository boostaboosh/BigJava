••• P7.10
In this assignment, you will implement a simulation of a popular casino game usually called video poker.
The card deck contains 52 cards, 13 of each suit.
At the beginning of the game, the deck is shuffled. You need to devise a fair method for shuffling.
(It does not have to be efficient.)
The player pays a token for each game.
Then the top five cards of the deck are presented to the player.
The player can reject none, some, or all of the cards.
The rejected cards are replaced from the top of the deck.
Now the hand is scored.
Your program should pronounce it to be one of the following:
• No pair—The lowest hand, containing five separate cards that do not match up to create any of the hands below.
• One pair—Two cards of the same value, for example two queens. Payout: 1
• Two pairs—Two pairs, for example two queens and two 5’s. Payout: 2
• Three of a kind—Three cards of the same value, for example three queens. Payout: 3
• Straight—Five cards with consecutive values, not necessarily of the same suit, such as 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
  The ace can either precede a 2 or follow a king. Payout: 4
• Flush—Five cards, not necessarily in order, of the same suit. Payout: 5
• Full House—Three of a kind and a pair, for example three queens and two 5’s. Payout: 6
• Four of a Kind—Four cards of the same value, such as four queens. Payout: 25
• Straight Flush—A straight and a flush: Five cards with consecutive values of the same suit. Payout: 50
• Royal Flush—The best possible hand in poker. A 10, jack, queen, king, and ace, all-of-the same suit. Payout: 250

problem-solving:
a deck has 52 cards, 13 of each suit, in order. so a card has a suit and a value.
a deck can be shuffled.

for a game to be played:
a player pays a token to play a game
the deck is shuffled
the top 5 cards of the deck are presented to the user
the player can reject none, some, or all of the cards
The rejected cards are replaced from the top of the deck
now the hand is scored

which aspects of a video poker simulator do I need to model?
 - ask the player to pay a token to play a game of video poker
 - shuffle a deck of 52 cards containing 13 cars of 4 different suits
 - present the 5 cards at the top of the deck to the player
 - the player can reject none, some, or all of the cards
 - the rejected cards are replaced from the top of the deck
 - the hand is now scored as either:
    * no pair: 5 cards that do not match any of the scoring hands below, payout: 0
    * one pair: two cards of the same value, payout: 1
    * two pairs: two pairs of two cards of the same value, payout: 2
    * three of a kind: three cards of the same value, payout: 3
    * straight: five cards with consecutive values (the ace can either precede a 2 or follow a king), payout: 4
    * flush: five cards, not necessarily in order, of the same suit, payout: 5
    * full house: three of a king and a pair, payout: 6
    * four of a kind: four cards of the same value, payout: 25
    * straight flush: straight and a flush, payout: 50
    * royal flush: the best hand in poker, a flush and a straight with card values 10-jack-queen-king-ace, payout: 250

Now, I can specify the public interface of the VideoPokerSimulator class by applying method calls to a sample object
