Write a program that plays tic-tac-toe.
The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3 × 3 grid as in the photo at right.
The game is played by two players, who take turns.
The first player marks moves with a circle, the second with a cross.
The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of three marks wins.
Your program should draw the game board, ask the user for the coordinates of the next mark,
change the players after every successful move, and pronounce the winner.

problem-solving:

The tic-tac-toe grid is made up of 9 squares which can have one of two values: circle or square.

I'm going to make a TicTacToePlayer class

implementing a class:
step 1 - list the methods you are asked to supply. Use a sample object.
sample objects use:
TicTacToePlayer game = new TicTacToePlayer();
while !game.isFinished
    game.nextMove()

a game will have a player it is expected the next turn from.
and a game will have a winner
a game will have a ticTacToeGrid (can be a 3x3 2D array of cells)
a ticTacToeGrid will have cells
cells will have empty, circle, or cross symbols.
