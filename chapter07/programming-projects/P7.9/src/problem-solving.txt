Write a program that plays tic-tac-toe.
The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3 × 3 grid as in the photo at right.
The game is played by two players, who take turns.
The first player marks moves with a circle, the second with a cross.
The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of three marks wins.
Your program should draw the game board, ask the user for the coordinates of the next mark,
change the players after every successful move, and pronounce the winner.

problem-solving:

The tic-tac-toe grid is made up of 9 squares which can have one of two values: circle or square.

I'm going to make a TicTacToePlayer class

implementing a class:
step 1 - list the methods you are asked to supply. Use a sample object.
sample objects use:
TicTacToePlayer game = new TicTacToePlayer();
while !game.isFinished
    game.nextMove()

a game will have a player it is expected the next turn from.
and a game will have a winner
a game will have a ticTacToeGrid (can be a 3x3 2D array of cells)
a ticTacToeGrid will have cells
cells will have empty, circle, or cross symbols.

finding 3-in-a-column problem-solving

step 1 - I need to try and understand the problem
What are the inputs? a 3x3 2D-array
What are the desired outputs? true if the values in one of the columns
        are all the same and not empty

step 2 - solve an example of the problem by hand
x o x
x x o
x o x
there are 3 identical values in a column.
the first column has the second value equal to the second and the third
equal to the second. the others are all non-valid options from the second
row onwards

step 3 - write pseudocode for solving the problem
firstRow = first element in 2D array
firstCell = get value of first cell in row
secondRow = second element in 2D array
secondCell = get value of first cell in row
thirdRow = third element in 2D array
thirdCell = get value of first cell in row
if firstCell == secondCell == thirdCell
    is three in a column

while...
    row = element at rowCounter in array
    first cell = element at first index in row
    if first cell == previous cell
        keep going
    increment rowCounter

I want to reach the end of the 2D array

count controlled
while rowCounter < 2D array length and keep going
    row = element at index rowCounter in 2D array
    first cell = element at first index in row
    if first cell == previous cell
        previous cell = first cell
        if rowCounter = 2D array length - 1
            three in a column = true
    else
        done = true
    increment rowCounter

I need to do this for each column
first column index = 0
second column index = 1
third column index = 2

columnIndexCounter = 0
if columnIndexCounter < 2D array row length
    do stuff with elements of that column (previous loop)
    increment column counter

count controlled loop
three in a column = false
while columnIndexCounter < 2D array row length and ! three in a column
    rowIndexCounter = 1 // start at 2nd row because we compare to previous row
    while rowIndexCounter < 2D array length and keep going
        row = element at rowIndexCounter in 2D array
        column cell = element at columnIndexCounter in row
        previous row = element at rowIndexCounter - 1 in 2D array
        column previous row cell = element at columnIndexCounter in previous row
        if column cell value == column previous row cell value
            if rowCounter = 2D array length - 1
                three in a column = true
        else
            keep going = false
        increment rowCounter
    increment column counter

I forgot to check if cells in the column are empty!
quick fix:

three in a column = false
while columnIndexCounter < 2D array row length and ! three in a column
    rowIndexCounter = 1 // start at 2nd row because we compare to previous row
    while rowIndexCounter < 2D array length and keep going
        row = element at rowIndexCounter in 2D array
        column cell = element at columnIndexCounter in row
        previous row = element at rowIndexCounter - 1 in 2D array
        column previous row cell = element at columnIndexCounter in previous row
        if column cell value == column previous row cell value
                && column cell value != empty
            if rowCounter = 2D array length - 1
                three in a column = true
        else
            keep going = false
        increment rowCounter
    increment column counter
