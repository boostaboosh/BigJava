•• E7.15 Add a method
public Sequence sum(Sequence other)
to the Sequence class of Exercise •• E7.12 that yields the sum of this sequence and
another. If the sequences don’t have the same length, assume that the missing elements are zero. For example, the sum of
1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11
and
11 11 7 9 16 4 1
is the sequence
12 15 16 25 25 11 5 9 11
