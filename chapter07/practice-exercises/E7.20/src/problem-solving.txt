problem-solving
step 1 - understand the problem.
what are the inputs?
an array of values
a max bar length
a different way of computing the value of a unit in the bar chart
        if the largest value in the array is larger or smaller than max bar length
what are the desired outputs?
a sequence of vertical columns representing the values in the array with the tallest value being 20 units high
step 2 - solve examples of the problem by hand
imagine max length = 20
[1, 5, 10]

step 3 - write a pseudocode algorithm for solving general instances of the problem I just solved an instance of by hand
we start with top row
top row = row number 20 (max height)
array = copy of actual array [1, 20, 40]
print array = relative to max bar copy of array, so [1, 10, 20]
currentRow = top row
lastRow = 0
if column 1 == currentRow
print space for column 1 because
print space for column 2
print asterisk for column 3
if column 2 (i.e. column counter + 1)
... basically if column number == print array number then print a symbol
implement loop
steps to repeat
if column1 == current row
    print *
else
    print space

turning these steps into uniform steps:
while...
    if barValue == currentRowValue
        print barChartUnitSymbol
    else
        print space

looping condition
    Repeat for each bar in the chart.
    What goal do I want to reach?
    I want to print symbols or spaces for each bar in the chart.

for each bar in the chart
    if barValue == currentRowValue
        print barChartUnitSymbol
    else
        print space

loop type
count controlled because barNumber in incremented by one for each iteration of the loop
for barChartValue in barChartValues from index 0 to last
    if barValue == currentRowValue
        print barChartUnitSymbol
    else
        print space

back to the pseudocode:

top row = max_bar_height
valuesToChart = copy of actual array [1, 20, 40]
barChartValues = relative to max bar copy of array, so [1, 10, 20]
currentRow = top row
lastRow = 0
for row from max_bar_height to 1
    for barChartValue in barChartValues from index 0 to last
        if barValue == currentRowValue
            print barChartUnitSymbol
            decrement barChartValue in barChartValues by 1
        else
            print space
    print new line
