•• E7.22
Improve the program of Exercise •• E7.19 by adding captions for each bar. Prompt
the user for the captions and data values. The output should look like this:

      Egypt **********************
     France ****************************************
      Japan ****************************
    Uruguay **************************
Switzerland **************

I already have a horizontal bar chart drawing method.
So, all I need to do is ask users to input a caption for each value they input.
And then when I print out the bar chart I need to add the caption associated
with each value first and make sure that the captions take up the same amount
of characters so that the bars all start at the same point. I can probably use
a format string for this, where I can specify the width of the Strings.
