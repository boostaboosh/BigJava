•• E7.13
Add a method
public boolean sameValues(Sequence other)
to the Sequence class of Exercise •• E7.12
that checks whether two sequences have the
same values in some order, ignoring duplicates.
For example, the two sequences
1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11
and
11 11 7 9 16 4 1
would be considered identical.
You will probably need one or more helper methods.
