•• P6.9
In the 17th century, the discipline of probability theory got its start when a gambler
asked a mathematician friend to explain some observations about dice games. Why
did he, on average, win a bet that at least one six would appear when rolling a die
four times? And why did he seem to lose a similar bet, getting at least one double-six
when rolling a pair of dice 24 times?
Nowadays, it seems astounding that any person would roll a pair of dice 24 times in
a row, and then repeat that many times over. Let’s do that experiment on a computer
instead. Simulate each game a million times and print out the wins and losses,
assuming each bet was for $1.

computation problem-solving
1 - understand the problem
What are the inputs?
1) a bet that at least one 6 would appear when rolling a die four times
2) a bet that at least one double 6 (12) would appear when rolling a pair of
   dice 24 times
What are the outputs?
1) The number of wins and losses when simulating the first bet 1'000'000 times
2) The number of wins and losses when simulating the second bet 1'000'000 times

2 - solve typical examples of the problem by hand
Hard to do this many times. That's the point of using a computer.
But I can imagine a few dice rolls.
bet 1 sim 1
roll die. 5
roll die. 2
roll die. 2
roll die. 6
bet 1
sumOfWinsAndLosses + 1
bet 1 sim 2
roll die. 4 roll die. 2
roll die. 1 roll die. 3
etc. 24 times.
bet2SumOfWinsAndLosses - 1 (because probably a loss)

3 - write pseudocode for solving the problem
numberOfBetsToSimulate = 1_000_000
numberOfBets = 0

oneDieBetSumOfWinsAndLosses = 0
twoDiceBetSumOfWinsAndLosses = 0

for numberOfBets from 1 to 1_000_000
    // one die bet simulation
    oneDieBetVictory = false
    for numberOfDieRolls from 1 to 4
        dieResult = random number between 1 and 6
        if dieResult == 6
            oneDieBetVictory = true
    if oneDieBetVictory == true
        oneDieBetSumOfWinsAndLosses = oneDieBetSumOfWinsAndLosses + 1
    else
        oneDieBetSumOfWinsAndLosses--

    // two die bet simulation
    twoDieBetVictory = false
    for numberOfDieRolls from 1 to 24
        dieOneResult = random number from 1 to 6
        dieTwoResult = random number from 1 to 6
        if dieOneResult == dieTwoResult && dieTwoResult == 6
            twoDieBetVictory = true
    if twoDieBetVictory == true
        twoDieBetSumOfWinsAndLosses++
    else
        twoDieBetSumOfWinsAndLosses--

The wins and losses after placing 1 million bets that at least one 6 would
appear when rolling a die 4 times are oneDieBetSumOfWinsAndLosses

The wins and losses after placing 1 million bets that
at least one double 6 (12) would appear when rolling a pair
of dice 24 times are twoDieBetSumOfWinsAndLosses

4 - turn the pseudocode into Java statements
