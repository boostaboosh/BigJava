••• P6.5 The game of Nim.

This is a well-known game with a number of variants.
The following variant has an interesting winning strategy.

Two players alternately take marbles from a pile.
In each move, a player chooses how many marbles to take.

The player must take at least one but at most half of the marbles.
Then the other player takes a turn. The player who takes the last marble loses.

Write a program in which the computer plays against a human opponent.

Generate a random integer between 10 and 100 to denote the initial size of the pile.

Generate a random integer between 0 and 1 to decide whether the computer or
the human takes the first turn.

Generate a random integer between 0 and 1 to decide whether the computer
plays smart or stupid.
In stupid mode the computer simply takes a random legal value
(between 1 and n/2) from the pile whenever it has a turn.
In smart mode the computer takes off enough marbles to make
the size of the pile a power of two minus 1 —that is, 3, 7, 15, 31, or 63.
That is always a legal move, except when the size of the pile is currently
one less than a power of two. In that case, the computer makes
a random legal move.

You will note that the computer cannot be beaten in smart mode when it has
the first move, unless the pile size happens to be 15, 31, or 63.
Of course, a human player who has the first turn and knows the winning strategy
can win against the computer.

problem-solving:
I'm going to try and solve this problem, or more precisely build this project
without consulting the how-to tutorials. This way I force myself to remember
the steps which should be pretty clear in my mind by now.

I think I'll make a class called GameOfNim. Wait, what I'll do is just write
an example scenario of me playing this game in pseudocode.
Basically:

ask user if they want to play a game of nim.
if they say yes
    GameOfNim nimGame = new GameOfNim();
    while !nimGame.isOver
        nimGame.nextTurn()
