What is an infinite loop? On your computer, how can you terminate a program that
executes an infinite loop?

An infinite loop executes a series of instructions over and over again forever without ever stopping.
On my computer I can execute an infinite loop by closing the program window or by pressing the stop 
button in my integrated development environment (text editor, compiler, and executer).
