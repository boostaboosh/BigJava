What is a sentinel value? Give a simple rule when it is appropriate to use a numeric
sentinel value.

A sentinel value is a value that denotes the end of a series of a data but is not part of the data 
itself.
For example, if you are reading input from a user you may tell the user to input the value zero to 
denote that they are finished with data input. In this example zero is a sentinel value. 
Just like a real life sentinel who acts as a guard for people passing by some passage or border, in a 
programming a sentinel value acts as a guard for data input by letting in values that preceed it and 
not letting following values "pass".

It is appropriate to use a numeric sentinel value when not all numeric values are accepted.
For example, if you are reading in positive integers greater than zero from the user it is appropriate 
to use zero or minus one as a sentinel value. 
However, if you are reading in numeric values that can be positive or negative or zero then you may not
use any numeric integer value as a sentenel value to denote the end of data entry on behalf of the user
because the user may want to input the senetel value as part of the data set.
