Explain in detail how to use your debugger to inspect the balance stored in a BankAccount object.

Place a breakpoint on a line where a variable containing a reference to a BankAccount object is in scope.
Run the debugger by pressing the bug icon in IntelliJ at the top right hand side of the window.
In the debugger pain press the arrow next to the name of the variable which contains a reference to the BankAccount object.
A list of instance variables belonging to that instance of the BankAccount object will appear, including balance and its value.
