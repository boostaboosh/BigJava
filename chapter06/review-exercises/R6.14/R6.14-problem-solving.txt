Write pseudocode for a program that prints a Celsius/Fahrenheit conversion table
such as the following.
Celsius | Fahrenheit
--------+-----------
      0 |         32
     10 |         50
     20 |         68
  . . .        . . .
    100 |        212

computation problem-solving

step 1) understand the problem: what are the inputs and outputs?
inputs:
Celsius temperature values from 0 to 100 in increments of 10: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
outputs:
the Fahrenheit temperature conversions of the Celsius values in the requested format.

step 2) work out examples by hand
C       F
0       0 * 1.8 + 32 = 0 + 32 + 32
10      18 + 32 = 50
20      20 * 1.8 + 32 = 2 * 10 * 1.8 + 32 = 36 + 32 = 68

step 3) write an algorithm for computing the answers to general instances of the problem using the method you used when
solving the problem by hand

print Celsius
print space
print bar
print space
print fahreneheit
print

print 8 dashes
print +
print 11 dashes
print new line

print 0 in format string with field width of 7
print space + bar
print 32 in format string with field width of 11
print new line
print 10 in format string with field width of 7
print space + bar
print 50 in format string with field width of 11
print new line
...

how to implement a loop problem-solving
step 1) determine which instructions you want to repeat
If you're unsure about write down the steps you would take to solve the problem by hand.
I did this in the previous step when writing an algorithm for computing answers to general instances of the problem:

celsiusTemperature = 0
fahrenheitScalingFactor = 1.8
fahrenheitTranslationFactor = 32
fahrenheitTemperature = celsiusTemperature * fahrenheitScalingFactor * fahrenheitTranslationFactor
print celsiusTemperature in format string with field width 7
print space concatenated with the bar symbol
print fahrenheitTemperature in format string with field width of 11
print new line
increase celsiusTemperature temperature by 10
...

Then, reduce the steps you took when working the problem out by hand to a uniform set of instructions, i.e, a set of
instructions that doesn't change for each step.

celsiusTemperature = 0
fahrenheitScalingFactor = 1.8
fahrenheitTranslationFactor = 32
fahrenheitTemperature = celsiusTemperature * fahrenheitScalingFactor * fahrenheitTranslationFactor
print celsiusTemperature in format string with field width 7
print space concatenated with the bar symbol
print fahrenheitTemperature in format string with field width of 11
print new line
increase celsiusTemperature temperature by 10

so our loop looks like this now:
while *some condition* is true repeat the following steps:
    fahrenheitScalingFactor = 1.8
    fahrenheitTranslationFactor = 32
    fahrenheitTemperature = celsiusTemperature * fahrenheitScalingFactor * fahrenheitTranslationFactor
    print celsiusTemperature in format string with field width 7
    print space concatenated with the bar symbol
    print fahrenheitTemperature in format string with field width of 11
    print new line
    increase celsiusTemperature temperature by 10

step 2 - determine the looping condition
What goal do you want to reach in your loop to reach?
I want the Celsius temperature to reach 100.
So our loop looks like this now:
while celsiusTemperature <= 100
    fahrenheitScalingFactor = 1.8
    fahrenheitTranslationFactor = 32
    fahrenheitTemperature = celsiusTemperature * fahrenheitScalingFactor * fahrenheitTranslationFactor
    print celsiusTemperature in format string with field width 7
    print space concatenated with the bar symbol
    print fahrenheitTemperature in format string with field width of 11
    print new line
    increase celsiusTemperature temperature by 10

step 3 - determine the loop type: count controlled or event controlled?
This is a count controlled loop because there is a counter variable (celsiusTemperature) which is incremented by a
constant amount once per loop iteration loop until it reaches a target value (100).
We can also determine that this is a count controlled loop because we know how many times we want it to execute: once
for each multiple of 10 from 0 to 100.
in Java count controlled loops are implemented using for loops.
so, our loop looks like this now
while celsiusTemperature <= 100 do the following and then increase celsiusTemperature by 10 after each loop iteration
    fahrenheitScalingFactor = 1.8
    fahrenheitTranslationFactor = 32
    fahrenheitTemperature = celsiusTemperature * fahrenheitScalingFactor * fahrenheitTranslationFactor
    print celsiusTemperature in format string with field width 7
    print space concatenated with the bar symbol
    print fahrenheitTemperature in format string with field width of 11
    print new line

step 4 - set up variables for entering the loop for the first time: decide what value to initialise them with
celsiusTemperature = 0

step 4 of computation problem-solving - declare the variables and constants you need and specify their types
constant double FAHRENHEIT_SCALING_FACTOR = 1.8
constant int FAHRENHEIT_TRANSLATION_FACTOR = 32
constant int LAST_VALUE = 100
int celsiusTemperature
int fahrenheitTemperature

step 5 - translate the pseudocode to the Java language
