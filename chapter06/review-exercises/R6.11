Which loop statements does Java support? Give simple rules for when to use each
loop type.

Java supports three different loop statements:
the for loop
the while loop
and the do loop

We distinguish between two major loop types: count controlled loops and event controlled loops.
Count controlled loops control the execution of the statements to be repeated using a counter variable
which is incremented or decremented by a constant amount until it reach a target value thereby 
falsifying the looping condition.
Event controlled loops control the execution of the loop using a condition which is falsified when some
event occurs. 
A count controlled loop is a specific type of event controlled loop where the event is a counter 
variable reaching a target value.

The for loop in Java is a count controlled loop.
We use it for implementing count controlled loops. 
I.e., we use a for loop when we want to implement a loop where a value is incremented or decremented by 
a constant amount until it reaches a target value. 
This value is known as a counter and is stored in a counter variable. 
This is usually the case when we know how many times we want a loop to execute in advance.
For example, ten times, or once for every number between 0 and the length of a string.
Because we can use a counter variable to count loop iterations until it reaches a target, for example
ten or the length of a string.

A while loop in Java is an event controlled loop. 
We use it for implementing event controlled loops.
I.e., we use when we want to implement a loop which will execute until some event occurs.
If we don't have a value which is incremented or decremented by a constant amount until it reaches a 
target value we use a while loop.
This is usually the case when we don't know how many times we want the loop to execute in advance.
For example, if we want to execute some instructions repeatedly until a user enters a certain value or
if we want to execute some instructions repeatedly until some variable reaches some value withouot
being incremented or decremented by a constant amount each time.

A do loop in Java is a special type of event controlled loop which executes the loop body, i.e., 
the instructions to be repeated over and over again by the loop, once before testing if the looping 
condition is true. A do loop is also known as a post-test loop because the condition is tested after 
executing the loop body in contrast to pre-test loops which test the condition before executing the 
loop body.
We use a do loop when we need to execute the loop body at least once before being able to check 
if the looping condition is true.
For example, if you want the user to input a certain type of value you can use a do loop to ask the 
user for input before testing if the input value is valid via the looping condition. 
If the input is not valid the do loop will ask the user for input again and again until it is. 
So, the do loop can be user to read an input value once before testing if the value is of the type you
wanted.
