Write pseudocode for a program that prints a calendar such as the following.

Su  M  T  W Th  F Sa
          1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8  9 10 11
12 13 14 15 16 17 18
19 20 21 22 23 24 25
26 27 28 29 30 31

how to write a loop step by step 
step 1 - decide what actions need to be repeated over and over again
if you're having trouble figuring this out, write out the steps you would take if you were solving the
problem by hand.

on the first row write the column headers su m t w th f sa

on the second row leave three spaces and then write 1 2 3 4
on the third row write 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
on the fourth row write 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
...

then, reduce the steps you wrote down to a set of instructions that doesn't change for each step
of the hand solved problem.

output su m t w t f sa
output "     "

print date
if date % 7 == 4
   print new line
increment date by 1

step 2 - determine the looping condition.
What is the goal of the loop?
I want the date to reach 31

step 3 - determine the loop type
We distinguish between two types of loops: count controlled loops and event controlled loops.
A count controlled loop is controlled by a variable called a counter which is increased by a constant 
amount each time the loop is executed until it reach a target value, thereby falsifying the looping
condition. 
An event controlled loop is controlled by an event which occurs and falsifies the looping condition.

If we know how many times a loop will execute in advance we should use a counter controlled loop, i.e.,
a for loop in Java.

the loop is a count controlled loop because we want it to execute 31 times and the date variable acts
as a counter which is incremented by the constant amount of one for each iteration of the loop.

step 4 - list all variables you need for entering the loop for the first time and decide what values to 
initialise these variables with

I need the date variable and that's it.
I will initialise the date with a value of 1

step 5 - process results after the loop is done executing all of its iterations
I don't need to process any results with any variables updates during the execution of the loop because
I am interested in the output during the execution of the loop.

our loop looks like this:


for date from 1 to 31
   print date
   if date % 7 == 4
      print new line

step 6 - hand trace your loop for 3 to 5 iterations to make sure variables hold expected values and the
loop works as expected. pay attention when entering the loop for the first time and when entering the 
loop for the last time.
date output iteration
1	1	1
2	2	2
3	3	3
4	4\n	4
5	5	5
...		
31	31	31

step 7 - translate pseudocode to java
Not necessary for this exercise

the final pseudocode for a program that prints a calendar such as the one shown is:

print  Su  M  T  W Th  F Sa
print "         "

for date from 1 to 31
   print format string ("%2d ", date)
   if date % 7 == 4
      print new line
