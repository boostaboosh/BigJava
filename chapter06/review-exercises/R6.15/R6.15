Write pseudocode for a program that reads a student record, consisting of the student’s first and last name, 
followed by a sequence of test scores and a sentinel of –1.
The program should print the student’s average score. Then provide a trace table for
this sample input:
Harry Morgan 94 71 86 95 -1

Computation problem solving (how to 4.1 - Big Java page 118 ch04)

Step 1
Determine the inputs and outputs

Inputs
firstName
secondName
testScore1
testScore2
testScoreN
sentinelValue

Output
averageTestScore

Step 2
Work out examples by hand (if you can't compute the solution yourself, it's unlikely you'll be able to write 
an algorithm that can)

Example
James Butler 40 42 70 70 70 70 -1
40 + 42 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 70 = 362
362 / 6 = 60.33333333333333333 recurring

Step 3
Write a pseudocode algorithm for computing answers to general instances of the problem by using the method
you used when solving the problem by hand. So reduce the steps from your hand worked example to a series of 
steps that are the same no matter the instance of the problem being solved.

Pseudocode algorithm:

Output "Enter student record on one line: first and last name followed by test scores. Enter -1 to indicate the end of test score entries."
Create a scanner object with the computer keyboard as the input stream
Scan the next token in the input stream which is the second name of the student
Scan the next token in the input stream which is the last name of the student
Assign numberOfScores a starting value of zero
Assign sumOfScores a starting value of zero
Scan the next value in the scanner's input as an integer and assign this value to testScore
If testScore is equal to -1
   Output "no tests scores inputted"
Otherwise
   Add testScore to sumOfScores
   Add 1 to numberOfScores
Scan the next value in the scanner's input as an integer and assign this value to testScore   
If testScore is equal to -1
   Assign averageTestScore a value of sumOfScores / numberOfScores
   Output averageTestScore
Otherwise
   Add testScore to sumOfTerms
   Add 1 to numberOfTerms
... repeat until -1 entry is found (what is no -1 entry is found? It becomes an infinite loop.)

How to implement a loop problem solving (how to 6.1 - Big Java page 203 ch06)

Step 1
Decide which instructions you want to repeat. If you can't figure it out write down the steps you would take when solving
The problem by hand.

Scan the next value in the scanner's input as an integer and assign this value to testScore
If testScore is equal to -1
   Output "no tests scores inputted"
Otherwise
   Add testScore to sumOfScores
   Add 1 to numberOfScores
Scan the next value in the scanner's input as an integer and assign this value to testScore   
If testScore is equal to -1
   Assign averageTestScore a value of sumOfScores / numberOfScores
   Output averageTestScore
Otherwise
   Add testScore to sumOfTerms
   Add 1 to numberOfTerms
... repeat until -1 entry is found (what is no -1 entry is found? It becomes an infinite loop.)

Then look at the steps you took when working out the problem by hand and reduce them to a uniform set of instructions, i.e., 
a set of instructions that does not change for each step.

Scan the next token in the scanner's input stream as an integer and assign this value to testScore
If testScore equals sentinelValue
   Assign averageTestScore a value of sumOfScores / numberOfScores
   Output averageTestScore
Otherwise
   Add testScore to sumOfTerms
   Add 1 to numberOfTerms

Step 2
Specify the loop condition.

We want number values to be treated as test scores and added to the sum of scores until the sentinel value is inputted.

Step 3
Determine the loop type. Count controlled loop or event controlled loops are the two types of loop.
Count controlled loops are controlled by a counter variable which is incremented by a constant amount once per loop iteration
until it reaches a target value.

This is not a count controlled loop, which is a specific type of loop, because it doesn't meet all the requirements of a count
Controlled loop. So, this is an event controlled loop.
This is an event controlled loop because we want to repeat the loop instructions until an event takes place, i.e., until the 
Sentinel value is reached in the scanner's input stream.

While inputNumber != sentinelValue
   Assign inputNumber to testScore
   Add testScore to sumOfScores
   Add 1 to numberOfScores
   Scan the next value in the scanner's input as an integer and assign this value to inputNumber

Step 4
Set up loop variables for entering the loop for the first time. 
List all the variables that are used and updated in the loop and determine how to initialise them.

inputNumber = value of next integer token in the scanner's input stream
sentinelValue = -1
sumOfScores = 0
numberOfScores = 0

Our loop looks like this:
inputNumber = value of next integer token in the scanner's input stream
sentinelValue = -1
sumOfScores = 0
numberOfScores = 0
While inputNumber != sentinelValue
   Assign inputNumber to testScore
   Add testScore to sumOfScores
   Add 1 to numberOfScores
   Scan the next value in the scanner's input as an integer and assign this value to inputNumber

Continuation of step 3 of computation problem solving using the loop we have implemented

Pseudocode algorithm:

Output "Enter student record on one line: first and last name followed by test scores, followed by -1 to indicate the end of test score entries."
Create a scanner object with the computer keyboard as the input stream
Scan the next token in the input stream which is the first name of the student
Scan the next token in the input stream which is the last name of the student
inputNumber = value of next integer token in the scanner's input stream
sentinelValue = -1
sumOfScores = 0
numberOfScores = 0
While inputNumber != sentinelValue
   Assign inputNumber to testScore
   Add testScore to sumOfScores
   Add 1 to numberOfScores
   Scan the next value in the scanner's input as an integer and assign this value to inputNumber
averageTestScore = sumOfScores / numberOfScores
Output averageTestScore
