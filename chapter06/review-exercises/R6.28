What are nested loops? Give an example where a nested loop is typically used.

Nest loops are loops inside the body of other loops.
Loops are used when you want to tell the computer to repeat the execution of some instructions.
So, a loop inside of another loop, i.e., a nested loop, is used when you want to tell the computer to repeat something repeatedly.
For example, if you want to print a table made up of rows and columns it is common to tell the computer to print rows using an outer loop, and to print column values for each row using a nested loop internal to the outer loop. 
This is because printing a row requires printing a value for each column value. 
For example, if you are printing a table which contains the 10 x table for numbers 1 through 9 then for each row representing a number (outer loop) you will need to print the value of said number first by 1, then by 2, then by 3, etc. (inner or nested loop).
