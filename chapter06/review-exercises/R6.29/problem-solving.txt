The nested loops
for (int i = 1; i <= height; i++)
{
 for (int j = 1; j <= width; j++) { System.out.print("*"); }
 System.out.println();

Write a single for loop that displays the same rectangle.

computation problem-solving

step 1) understand the problem
what are the inputs?
height: an integer value which I can decide
width: an integer value which I can decide
what is the desired output?
A rectangle made up of asterisks of the given height and width.

step 2) work out example by hand
height: 3
width: 4

step 3) write a pseudocode algorithm for solving the general instances of the problem using
the method you used when solving the problem by hand.

implementing a for loop
step 1 - decide what instructions you want the computer to repeat. if you don't know, solve the problem
by hand and the turn the steps you took into a single set of instructions which is the same for each step
you took when solving the problem by hand.
print ****
step 2 - Decide what the looping condition is.
What is the goal of your loop?
To print a number of rows equal to the height of the rectangle.
step 3 - determine the loop type: count controlled or event controlled loop
the iterations of count controlled loops are controlled by a counter variable which is incremented once
per loop iteration until it reaches a target value.
this loop is a count controlled loop because it is controlled by a counter variable (rows) which is
incremented once per loop iteration until it reaches a target value (height).
for (rows = 1; rows <= height; rows++)
{
   print number of asterisks equal to width WITHOUT USING A NESTED LOOP.
}
step 4 - set up variables for entering the loop for the first time
list all the variables updated or used in the loop
rows
width
height
set rows to 1 in loop header.
set height to a positive integer before the loop
set width to a positive integer before the loop

our loop in pseudocode:
height = positive integer
width = positive integer
for rows from 0 to height
   print number of asterisks equal to width WITHOUT USING A NESTED LOOP

I can use the repeat method of the string class to return a string equal to the concatenation of a string
repeated X times.
