••• E6.7 Translate the following pseudocode for randomly permuting the characters in a
string into a Java program.

Read a word.
Repeat word.length() times
    Pick a random position i in the word, but not the last position.
    Pick a random position j > i in the word.
    Swap the letters at positions j and i.
Print the word.

To swap the letters, construct substrings as follows:
first   i   middle  j   last
Then replace the string with
first + word.charAt(j) + middle + word.charAt(i) + last
