pseudocode algorithm:
ask user to input number
assign smallest the input number
assign biggest the input number
ask user to input number
if number is smaller than smallest
   assign smallest number
else if number is bigger than biggest
   assign biggest number
ask user to input number or something that isn't a number
if number is smaller than smallest
   assign smallest number
if number is bigger than biggest
   assign biggest number
... if user enters something that isn't a number
output smallest and biggest

loop implementation
steps to repeat:
if !done
   ask user to input number
   if number is smaller than smallest
      assign smallest number
   else if number is bigger than biggest
      assign biggest number
   ask user if they are done
      if done
         assign done true

loop condition
What goal do you want to reach?
I want the user to be done

loop type:
event controlled loop: keep repeating until event occurs, i.e., until user says they are done

the loop:
while !done
   ask user to input an integer
   if integer < smallest
      smallest = integer
   else if integer > biggest
      biggest = integer
   ask user if they are done y/n
      if y
         done = true
output biggest and smallest
