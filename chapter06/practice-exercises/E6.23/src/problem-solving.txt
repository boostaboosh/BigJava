The Monty Hall Paradox.
Marilyn vos Savant described the following problem
(loosely based on a game show hosted by Monty Hall) in a popular magazine:
“Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind
one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host,
who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a
goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage
to switch your choice?”
Ms. vos Savant proved that it is to your advantage, but many of her readers, including
some mathematics professors, disagreed, arguing that the probability would not
change because another door was opened.
Your task is to simulate this game show. In each iteration, randomly pick a door
number between 1 and 3 for placing the car. Randomly have the player pick a door.
Randomly have the game show host pick a door having a goat (but not the door that
the player picked). Increment a counter for strategy 1 if the player wins by switching
to the third door, and increment a counter for strategy 2 if the player wins by
sticking with the original choice. Run 1,000 iterations and print both counters.

steps to be repeated
while...
    carDoor = random door between 1 and 3

    playerDoorPick = random between 1 and 3
    hostDoorPick = random between 1 and 3 excluding carDoor and playerDoorPick

    playerDoorSwitchPick = otherDoor excluding hostDoorPick and playerDoorPick

    if playerDoorSwitchPick = carDoor
    switchStategy = switchStrategy + 1
    else if playerDoorPick = carDoor
    stickStrategy = stickStrategy + 1

looping condition
    repeat until the loop has executed 1000 times

loop type
    count controlled

    for simulationCounter from 1 to 1000
        carDoor = random door between 1 and 3

        playerDoorPick = random between 1 and 3
        hostGoatDoorPick = random between 1 and 3
        while (hostGoatDoorPick == carDoor || hostGoatDoorPick == playerDoorPick)
            hostGoatDoorPick = random between 1 and 3

        playerDoorSwitchPick = 1
        if (hostDoorGoatPick == 1 || playerDoorPick == 1)
           playerDoorSwitchPick = 2
        if (hostDoorGoatPick == 2 || playerDoorPick == 2)
           playerDoorSwitchPick = 3

        if playerDoorSwitchPick = carDoor
         switchStrategy = switchStrategy + 1
        else if playerDoorPick = carDoor
         stickStrategy = stickStrategy + 1

loop variables initialisation
int simulationCounter = 1
int carDoor = random integer between 1 and 3
int playerDoorPick = random integer between 1 and 3
int hostDoorPick = random integer between 1 and 3
int playerDoorSwitchPick = 1;
int switchStrategyVictoryCounter = 0;
int stickStrategyVictoryCounter = 0;
int simulationNumber = 1000;

process the result after the loop is done
print "switch strategy victories out of simulationNumber: " switchStrategyVictoryCounter
print "stick strategy victories out of simulationNumber: " stickStrategyVictoryCounter
