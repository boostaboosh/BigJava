Write a program that reads a line of input as a string
and print only the uppercase letters in the string.

pt 1 - understand the problem
what are the inputs?

A string

What are the outputs?

The uppercase letters in the string

pt 2 - solve an example by hand

read the next character
if the character is uppercase
    print the character
...

while characterIndex < stringLength
    if character at characterIndex is uppercase
        print character
    characterIndex = characterIndex + 1

for character in string
    if character is uppercase
        print character
