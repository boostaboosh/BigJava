Write a program that reads a line of input as a string
and prints the number of vowels in the string.

carrying out computations how-to

p1 - understand the problem
What are the inputs?
A string
What are the desired outputs?
The number of vowels in the string

p2 - work out examples by hand
input: "Hello World!"
output: 3

p3 - write pseudocode for solving general instances of the problem
using the method you used for solving a specific instance of the problem by hand
inputLine = ask user for keyboard input
vowelCounter = 0
read nextCharacter from inputLine
if nextCharacter equals (ignore case) a, e, i, o, or u
    vowelCounter = vowelCounter + 1
repeat previous 3 steps until there are no more characters in userInput
output vowelCounter

implementing a loop how-to

s1 - decide the steps that need to be repeated inside the loop
while ...
    read nextCharacter from userInput
    if nextCharacter equals (ignore case) a, e, i, o, or u
        vowelCounter = vowelCounter + 1

s2 - specify the loop condition
What goal do you want to reach in your loop?
I want the loop to continue until there are no more characters in userInput.

s3 - determine the loop type: count-controlled or event controlled
Count controlled loops are controlled by a counter variable which is varied by a constant amount
This would be an event controlled loop because there is no counter variable, but I can introduce
a character counter variable which will iterate over each index in the input line.
for (characterCounter = 0; characterCounter < inputLine length; characterCounter = characterCounter + 1)
    nextCharacter = inputLine(characterCounter)
    if nextCharacter equals (ignore case) a, e, i, o, or u
        vowelCounter = vowelCounter + 1

s4 - setup variables for entering the loop for the first time
list all variable used in the loop and determine how to initialise them
characterCounter = 0
inputLine = user input
vowelCounter = 0

s5 - process the result after the loop has finished
inputLine = ask user for keyboard input
vowelCounter = 0
for (characterCounter = 0; characterCounter < inputLine length; characterCounter = characterCounter + 1)
    nextCharacter = inputLine(characterCounter)
    if nextCharacter equals (ignore case) a, e, i, o, or u
        vowelCounter = vowelCounter + 1
output vowelCounter

s6 - trace the loop with typical examples
done on paper

p4 and s7 - implement the loop in Java
