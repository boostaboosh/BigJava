Write a program that reads an integer and displays, using asterisks, a filled diamond
of the given side length.
For example, if the side length is 4, the program should display

computation problem solving

step 1
Understand the problem

What are the inputs? None
What is the desired output?

   ***

step 2
solve the problem by hand

step 3
write instructions for solving the problem

write 3 spaces 1 stars
write 2 spaces 3 stars
write 1 spaces 5 stars
write 0 spaces 7 stars
write 1 spaces 5 stars
write 2 spaces 3 stars
write 3 spaces 1 stars

it seems to me like the number of spaces decreases then increments by one.
The number of stars in the middle row is the same number of rows.
the number of stars on each row is odd.

implementing a loop

step 1
decide the steps that need to be repeated:

print spaces and stars
decrement spaces and increment stars by 2
print spaces and stars
decrement spaces and increment stars by 2
print spaces and stars
decrement spaces and increment stars by 2
print spaces and stars
increment spaces and decrement stars by 2
print spaces and stars
increment spaces and decrement stars by 2
print spaces and stars
increment spaces and decrement stars by 2
print spaces and stars

while...
    print spaces and stars
    if row < 4
        decrement spaces by 1
        increment stars by 2
    else if row >= 4
        increment spaces by 1
        decrement stars by 2
    increment rowCounter

step 2
specify the looping condition. what goal do I want to reach in my loop?
I want the number of rows to equal 7

step 3
determine the type of loop: count or event controlled
Count controlled loop because controlled by a counter variable (rowCounter)
which is varied once per loop iteration (+1)
until it reaches a target value (7)
the loop:
for row from 1 to 7
    print spaces times space and stars times star
    if row <= 4
        decrement spaces by 1
        increment stars by 2
    else if row > 4
        increment spaces by 1
        decrement spaces by 2

step 4
setup variables for entering the loop for the first time
spaces = 3
stars = 1

step 5
process the results after the loop has finished
Not applicable to this problem

step 6
trace the loop with typical examples
don't have paper at hand so will skip this time

step 7
implement the loop in java
See DiamondPrinter.java source code

continuation of computation problem-solving

step 4
declare the variables and constants that you need and specify they type
String star
String space
int spaces
int stars
int row

step 5
turn the pseudocode into Java statements
