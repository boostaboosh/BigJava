•• E6.17
Write a program that reads an integer and displays, using asterisks, a filled and hollow square,
placed next to each other. For example, if the side length is 5, the pro-gram should display:

***** *****
***** *   *
***** *   *
***** *   *
***** *****

computation problem-solving

step 1 - understand the problem

what are the inputs? None
What are the desired outputs?
***** *****
***** *   *
***** *   *
***** *   *
***** *****

step 2 - solve the problem by hand
***** *****
***** *   *
***** *   *
***** *   *
***** *****

step 3 - write pseudocode for solving the problem
print 5 asterisks
print 1 space
print 5 asterisks
print 5 asterisks
print 1 space
print 1 asterisk
print 3 spaces
print 1 print 1 asterisk
...repeat 2 more times
print 5 asterisks
print 1 space
print 5 asterisks

implementing a loop
step 1 - decide which steps need to be repeated
while...
    print asterisks
    print space
    print asterisk
    print spaces
    print asterisks

step 2 - specify the looping condition. What goal do you want to reach in your loop?
I want the number of rows to equal 5

step 3 - determine the type of loop: count or event controlled?
This is a count controlled loop because there is a counter variable (row) which is varied by
a constant amount (1) once per loop iteration until it reaches a target value (5).
loop pseudocode:
for row from 1 to 5
    print 5 asterisks
    print 1 space
    print 1 asterisk
    if row == 1 || row == 5
        secondSquareSymbol = "*"
    else
        secondSquareSymbol = " "
    print 3 secondSquareSymbol
    print 1 asterisk

step 4 - setup variables for entering the loop for the first time.
List all variables that are used and updated in the loop, and determine how to initialise them.
int row = 1
String secondSquareSymbol = ""

step 5 - process the result after the loop has finished
Not applicable

step 6 - trace the loop with typical examples
row |   secondSquareSymbol  |   output
----+-----------------------+---------------
1   |   *                   |   ***** *****
2   |   " "                 |   ***** *   *
3   |   " "                 |   ***** *   *
4   |   " "                 |   ***** *   *
5   |   " "                 |   ***** *****
--------------------------------------------

step 7 - implement the loop in Java
See SquareDrawer.java

continuation of computation problem-solving
step 4 - declare the variables and constants that you need, and specify their types
int row = 1
String secondSquareSymbol = ""

step 5 - turn the pseudocode into Java statements
