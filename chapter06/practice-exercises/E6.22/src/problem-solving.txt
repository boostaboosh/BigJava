Write a program that first asks the user to type
in today’s price of one dollar in Japanese yen,
then reads U.S. dollar values and converts each
to Japanese yen. Use 0 as the sentinel value
to denote the end of dollar inputs. Then the
program reads a sequence of yen amounts and converts them to dollars. The second
sequence is terminated by another zero value.

how to solve a computation problem

step 1 - understand the problem
What are the inputs?
1: the price of one dollar in Japanese yen
2: US dollar values
3: Japanese yen values

What are the desired outputs?
1: The Japanese yen values of the inputted dollar values
2: The dollar values of the inputted yen values

step 2 - solve the problem by hand
inputs:
1: 141.02
2: 1 100 4.32 0.1 100000 0
output 1: 141.02 14102.00 609.23 14.10 14102500.00
input 3: 1 100 500 2345.98 0
output 2: 0.0071 0.71 3.55 16.64

step 3 - write pseudocode for solving the problem
ask the user to type the price of one dollar in Japanese yen
ONE_USD_COST_IN_YEN = user input value
print "Enter US dollar values to convert to Yen (0 to end): "
dollarValue = next number in userInput
yenValue = dollarValue * ONE_USD_COST_IN_YEN
print $ dollarValue costs yenValue JPN yen
...repeat last 3 steps until next number in userInput = 0
print "Enter JPN yen amounts to convert to USD (0 to end): "
yenValue = next number in userInput
dollarValue = yenValue / ONE_USD_COST_IN_YEN
print JPN yenValue yen costs $ dollarValue
...repeat last 3 steps until next number in userInput = 0

how to implement a loop

step 1 - decide which actions need to be repeated
while...
    dollarValue = next number in userInput
    yenValue = dollarValue * ONE_USD_COST_IN_YEN
    print $ dollarValue costs yenValue JPN yen

step 2 - specify the looping condition?
What goal do I want to achieve in my loop?
I want to keep iterating the loop instructions until the user input is zero

step 3 - determine the loop type: count or event controlled
A count controlled loop is controlled by a counter variable which is incremented by a constant amount until it reaches a
target value. This is an event controlled loop because there is no counter variable.
while !done
    nextInput = nextValue in userInput
    if nextInput == 0
        done = true
    else
        dollarValue = nextInput
        yenValue = dollarValue * ONE_USD_COST_IN_YEN
        print $ dollarValue costs yenValue JPN yen

step 4 - list all the variables used and updated in the loop and decide how to initialise them
boolean done = false
double nextInput = nextValue in user input
double dollarValue = nextInput
double yenValue = dollarValue * ONE_USD_COST_IN_YEN

step 5 - process the result after the loop has finished
not applicable

step 6 - trace the loop variables with typical example values
cba

pseudocode now:

ask the user to type the price of one dollar in Japanese yen
ONE_USD_COST_IN_YEN = user input value

print "Enter US dollar values to convert to Yen (0 to end): "

while !done
    nextInput = nextValue in userInput
    if nextInput == 0
        done = true
    else
        dollarValue = nextInput
        yenValue = dollarValue * ONE_USD_COST_IN_YEN
        print $ dollarValue costs yenValue JPN yen

print "Enter JPN yen amounts to convert to USD (0 to end): "

yenValue = next number in userInput
dollarValue = yenValue / ONE_USD_COST_IN_YEN
print JPN yenValue yen costs $ dollarValue
...repeat last 3 steps until next number in userInput = 0

implement the second loop a la first loop

ask the user to type the price of one dollar in Japanese yen
ONE_USD_COST_IN_YEN = user input value

print "Enter US dollar values to convert to Yen (0 to end): "

while !done
    nextInput = nextValue in userInput
    if nextInput == 0
        done = true
    else
        dollarValue = nextInput
        yenValue = dollarValue * ONE_USD_COST_IN_YEN
        print $ dollarValue costs yenValue JPN yen

print "Enter JPN yen amounts to convert to USD (0 to end): "

while !done
    nextInput = nextValue in userInput
    if nextInput == 0
        done = true
    else
        yenValue = nextInput
        dollarValue = yenValue / ONE_USD_COST_IN_YEN
        print JPN yenValue yen costs $ dollarValue

step 4 - turn the pseudocode instructions into Java instructions
