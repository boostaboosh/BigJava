••• E9.15
Repeat Exercise •• E9.14, but in the BetterRectangle constructor, invoke the super-
class constructor.

•• E9.14 The java.awt.Rectangle class of the standard Java library does not supply a method
to compute the area or perimeter of a rectangle. Provide a subclass BetterRectangle of
the Rectangle class that has getPerimeter and getArea methods. Do not add any instance
variables. In the constructor, call the setLocation and setSize methods of the Rectangle
class. Provide a program that tests the methods that you supplied.
