•• E9.4
Reimplement the CheckingAccount class from How To 9.1
so that the first overdraft in any given month incurs a $20 penalty,
and any further overdrafts in the same month result in a $30 penalty.

if balance after withdrawal is negative
    // then this is an overdraft
    if this is first overdraft
        overdraft fee = 20
    otherwise
        overdraft fee = 30
