•• P9.2
Implement a class Clock whose getHours and getMinutes methods return the current
time at your location. (Call java.time.LocalTime.now().toString() and extract the time
from that string.) Also provide a getTime method that returns a string with the hours
and minutes by calling the getHours and getMinutes methods. Provide a subclass World-
Clock whose constructor accepts a time offset. For example, if you live in California,
a new WorldClock(3) should show the time in New York, three time zones ahead.
Which methods did you override? (You should not override getTime.)

problem-solving:

I just need to override the getHours method in the WorldClock.
This was so easy. How is this a medium difficulty project.
The hardest part was implementing the WorldClock get hours method
with floor mod so that the returned hours
would be between 0 and 23.
It feels like an easy/medium practice exercise.
