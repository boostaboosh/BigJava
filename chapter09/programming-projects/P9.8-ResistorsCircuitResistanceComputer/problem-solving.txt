In this problem, you will model a circuit consisting of an arbitrary configuration
of resistors.
Provide a superclass Circuit with an instance method getResistance.
Provide a subclass Resistor representing a single resistor.
Provide subclasses Serial and Parallel, each of which contains an ArrayList<Circuit>.
A Serial circuit models a series of circuits,
each of which can be a single resistor or another circuit.
Similarly, a Parallel circuit models a set of circuits in parallel.
For example, the circuit in the image is a Parallel circuit containing
a single resistor and one Serial circuit.
Use Ohm’s law to compute the combined resistance.

problem-solving:

First I need to understand how electricity works. See understanding-electricity.txt
After doing this research into how electricity works I now understand Ohm's law:
The Law
Ohm’s Law states that the current flowing through a conductor between two points
is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points
and inversely proportional to the resistance between them.

The Formula
V=IR
Where:
V is the voltage (potential difference) across the conductor, measured in volts (V).
I is the current flowing through the conductor, measured in amperes (A).
R is the resistance of the conductor, measured in ohms (Ω).
Understanding the Components

Visualizing Ohm’s Law
To help visualize Ohm’s Law, consider the water pipe analogy:
Voltage (V):
The pressure difference between the two ends of the pipe.
Current (I):
The flow rate of water through the pipe.
Resistance (R):
The properties of the pipe (such as diameter and roughness) that restrict water flow.

Increasing the pressure (voltage) increases the water flow (current) if
the pipe (resistance) remains the same.
Conversely, increasing the resistance (making the pipe narrower or rougher)
reduces the water flow (current) for a given pressure (voltage).

Summary
Ohm’s Law: Describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance
in a circuit.

Formula:
V=IR
Voltage (V) is the potential difference driving the current, measured in volts.
Current (I) is the flow of electric charge, measured in amperes.
Resistance (R) is the opposition to current flow, measured in ohms.

Applications:
Use the formula to calculate any one of the three variables if you know the other two.
Understanding Ohm’s Law helps in analyzing electrical circuits
and predicting how they will behave under different conditions.
