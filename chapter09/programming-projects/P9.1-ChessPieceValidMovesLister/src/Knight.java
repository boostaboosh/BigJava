/**
 * A knight is a chess piece which has an L-shaped movement pattern.
 * It can move 2 squares in forward, back, left, or right directions,
 * and then 1 square left or right from that position.
 * For example, if a black knight is on the E4 square it can legally move
 * to the G5 square by moving left by 2 squares to G4,
 * and then moving one square left to the G5 square.
 * Unlike all other traditional chess pieces,
 * a knight can move over other pieces if they are in the way
 * of its trajectory.
