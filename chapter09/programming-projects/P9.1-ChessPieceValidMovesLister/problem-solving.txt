Implement a class ChessPiece with method setPosition(String coordinates).
The coordinate string identifies the row and column in chess notation,
such as "d8" for the initial position of the black queen.
Also provide a method ArrayList<String> canMoveTo()
that enumerates the valid moves from the current position.
Provide subclasses Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, and King.
