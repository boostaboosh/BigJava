Explain the two benefits of using Java over machine code.

A computer executes a sequence of basic instructions in rapid succession. 
A computer program is a sequence of basic intructions and decisions.
The part of the computer that performs program control and data processing, i.e. executes computer programs, is called the central processing unit.
The basic instructions and decisions that make up a computer program must be broken down into a large number of more simple instructions in order for a computer's central processing unit to be able to execute them one by one. 
Humans don't require tasks to be broken down into extremely small and repetitive instructions like a computer does in order to understand them. So it is very tedious for a human to have to specify these even more simple instructions one by one, because it is repetitive and takes a long time.
Additionally, for the central processing unit to be able to read and understand these instructions they must be written in the form of machine code. Machine code is very difficult for humans to read and write instructions with, because it features only zeros and ones rather than the letters and words we are used to. This makes it very difficult for a human to read and write instructions with machine code, and error prone for a human to use.

Because of the issues related to using machine code, high-level programming languages have been created.
In a high level language you specify the actions that your program should carry out.
A compiler translates the high-level instructions into machine code, i.e., the more detailed instructions the computer's central processing unit can understand.
High level languages offer several advantages over machine code. Importantly a computer programmer using a high-level language can write a computer program without being extremely repetitive, and can use human language to write programs with rather than machine code which is very difficult to read and error prone.

Using the Java programming language over machine code when programming a computer offers two large benefits:
	- First of all Java is a high-level programming language which makes it easier and less error prone to use because it is less repetitive and easier to write and read than machine code. 
	- Secondly, Java is portable. The same program written with Java can be executed on Windows, UNIX, Linux, or Macintosh. In order to achieve portability the Java compiler does not translate programs written in the Java language to machine code instructions for the central processing unit. Instead, compiled Java programs contain instructions for the Java virtual machine: a program that simulates a central processing unit. Portability offers the benefit that you do not need to write programs for different platforms. On the other hand, a computer program written with machine code is platform dependant, and therefore the same computer program written in machine code cannot be executed on machines with platforms other than the one it was written for.
