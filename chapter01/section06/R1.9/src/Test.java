//        A compile-time error is an error that is found by the compiler when something is wrong with the program according to the rules of the language.
//        For this reason compile-time errors are also called syntax errors: because they are linguistic errors in the programming language.

//        When the compiler finds one or more errors, it refuses to translate the program source files into Java virtual machine instructions,
//        and as a consequence you have no program that you can run.
