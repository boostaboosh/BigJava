Review question R1.15

In order to estimate the cost of painting a house, a painter needs to know the surface
area of the exterior. Develop an algorithm for computing that value. Your inputs are
the width, length, and height of the house, the number of windows and doors, and
their dimensions. (Assume the windows and doors have a uniform size.)

step 1 
	understand the problem
	
		A painter needs to know the surface area of a house so he can estimate the cost of painting it.
	
step 2 
	develop and describe an algorithm (a sequence of steps that solve a problem when executed):

		step 1
			determine the inputs and outputs
		
				inputs:
					width of the house
					height of the house
					length of the house
					number of windows
					number of doors
					size of windows
					size of doors

				outputs:
					surface area of exterior

		step 2
			break the problem down into smaller problems
				
				We can determine the surface area of the exterior of a house using the house's measurements:
					The perimeter of the house is equal to the sum of its edges, i.e. the width of the house multiplied by two added to the length of the house multiplied by two
					The surface area of the exterior is equal to the perimeter of the house times the height of the house
					
				We can determine the surface area of the windows and doors using their quantity and measurements:
					the surface area of the windows is equal to the number of windows multiplied by the size of the windows
					the surface area of the doors is equal to the number of doors times the size of the doors
					the surface area of the windows and doors is equal to the surface area of the windows added to the surface area of the doors
					
				We can determine the paintable surface area of the house by subtracting the surface area of the windows and doors from the surface area of the exterior of the house
					the paintable surface area of the house is equal to surface area of the exterior subtracted by the surface area of the windows and doors
		
		step 3
			describe each subtask in pseudocode
				set perimeter of house to width of house multiplied by two added to the length of the house multiplied by two
				set surface area of the exterior of the house to the perimeter of the house times the height of the house
				set surface area of the windows to equal the number of windows multiplied by the size of the windows
				set the surface area of the doors to equal the number of doors multiplied by the size of the doors
				set the surface area of the doors and windows to equal the surface area of the windows added to the surface area of the doors
				set the paintable surface area of the house to equal the surface area of the exterior subtracted by the surface area of the windows and doors
				

step 3
	test the algorithm with simple inputs
	
		step 4
			test your pseudocode by working a problem
			
			inputs: length 10m, width 10m, height 15m, windows 2, doors 1, window size 1 m**2, door size 2 m**2
			
			house perimeter = 10 * 2 + 10 * 2 = 40
			house exterior surface area = house perimeter * height = 40 * 15 = 600
			surface area of windows = 2 * 1 = 2
			surface area of doors = 1 * 2 = 2
			surface area of windows and doors = 2 + 2 = 4
			paintable surface area of house exterior = house exterior surface area subtracted by surface area of windows and doors
			Report paintable surface area of house exterior
	
step 5
	translate the algorithm into Java

step 6
	compile and test your program
