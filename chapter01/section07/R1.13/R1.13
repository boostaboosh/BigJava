review question R1.13

Write an algorithm to settle the following question: A bank account starts out with
$10,000. Interest is compounded monthly at 6 percent per year (0.5 percent per
month). Every month, $500 is withdrawn to meet college expenses. After how many
years is the account depleted?

step 1
determine the inputs and outputs

inputs:
starting balance
annual interest
monthly interest
monthly expenses

outputs
After how many years is the account depleted, i.e., when is the balance = 0.

step 2
break down the problem into smaller tasks

Every month the balance changes. It loses the monthly expenses first of all. Then is gains the monthly interest rate.
balance = balance - monthly expenses
balance = balance * monthly interest

The algorithm will return the number of years that pass before the balance equals zero.

step 3
describe each subtask in pseudocode

	balance = starting balance
	monthly interest = annual interest / 12
	month = 0

	while the balance is more than 0
		add 1 to month
		remove monthly expenses from the balance
		set the monthly interest to monthly interest rate * balance
		add monthly interest to balance
	yearsPassed = number of months that have passed * 12
	Report number of years that have passed now that the balance is less than or equal to zero.

step 4
test your pseudocode by working a problem

sample values of inputs:
starting balance 10000
annual interest rate 6%
monthly interest rate 0.5%
monthly expenses $500

Here is the calculation for number of months that will pass before the balance equals zero:
	balance = 10000
	month = 0
	
	while month balance is more than 0
		month = 1
		balance = balance - monthly expenses = 10000 - 500 = 9500
		monthly interest = monthly interest rate * balance = 0.05 * 9500 = 475
		balance = balance + monthly interest = 9500 + 475 = 9975
		
		month = 2
		balance = 9975 - 500 = 9475
		monthly interest = 0.05 * 9475 = 473.75
		balance = 9475 + 473.75 = 9948.75
		
		month = 3
		balance = 9948.75 - 500 = 9448.75
		monthly interest = 0.05 * 9448.75 = 472.4375
		balance = 9448.75 + 472.4375 = 9921.1875
		
		...
