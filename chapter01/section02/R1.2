Which parts of a computer can store program code? Which can store program data?

Program instructions and data reside on secondary storage which provides slower less expensive storage that persists without electricity compared to primary storage.
When a program is started its instructions are bought into primary storage, also known as memory, where the central processing unit can read them.
The CPU reads and executes one instruction at a time. As directed by these instructions, the CPU reads data, modifies it, and writes it back to memory or secondary storage.
