Review exercise 1.4 page 1

A toaster is a single function device, but a computer can be programmed to carry out different tasks. Is your cell phone a single-function device, or is it a programmable computer?

My cell phone is a programmable computer because it can carry out many different functions based on the instructions given to it. There are different applications that run on my cell phone.
