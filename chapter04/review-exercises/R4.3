What is wrong with the following sequence of statements?
int mystery = 1;
mystery = mystery + 1;
int mystery = 1 - 2 * mystery;

The problem with this sequence of statements is that the variable name mystery
is declared as a variable which can store values of type int twice. 
This is an error because variables can only be declared once and new variables 
must have unique names.
