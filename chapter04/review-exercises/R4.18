Write pseudocode for a program that reads a name (such as Harold James Morgan) and
then prints a monogram consisting of the initial letters of the first, middle, and last
name (such as HJM). 

Step 1: understand the problem. What are the inputs and outputs?

There are three inputs:
1 - the word representing the first name
2 - the word representing the middle name
3 - the word representing the last name

The is one output:
1 - The string consisting of the initial letters of the first, middle, and last names.

Step 2: work out examples by hand

Input: "Jessie James West"

Output: "JJW"

Step 3: write pseudocode for computing the answers

output "Enter a first, middle, and last name"
firstName = next input word
middleName = next input word
lastName = next input word

firstNameInitial = firstName.substring(0,1)
MiddleNameInitial = middleName.substring(0,1)
LastNameInitial = lastName.substring(0,1)

Print output = firstInitial + secondInitial + thirdInitial
