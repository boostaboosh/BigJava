Write pseudocode for a program that reads a word and then prints the first character,
the last character, and the characters in the middle. For example, if the input is Harry,
the program prints H y arr.

Step 1 - understand the problem. What are the inputs and outputs?

In this problem there is one input: the word
And there are 3 outputs:
1- the first character of the word
2- the last character of the word
3- the middle characters of the word

Step 2 - work out examples by hand

For example the input word "Harry" would output "H y arr".

Step 3 - write pseudocode for computing the answers

Given a word = "aRandomWord"
firstLetter = word.charAt(0)
lastLetter = word.charAt(wordLength-1)
middleLetters = word.substring(1, wordLength - 1)
Output = firstLetter + lastLetter + middleLetters
Print the output
