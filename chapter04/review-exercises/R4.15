Explain the differences between 2, 2.0, '2', "2", and "2.0".

In Java every value is either a reference to an object or is one of the 8 primitive types.

2 is a number literal. A number literal is a number which occurs in a Java program as is. 
It is "literally" a number. 2 has no fractional part and can be of primitive type int, 
byte, short, or long. 

2.0 is a number literal. It is a floating point number because it has a decimal point. It 
can be represented by a float or double value of the float and double primitive types.

'2' is a character because it is enclosed in single quotes. A character is a primitive
type of value of type char which stores values of 2 bytes in size that represent code 
units in the unicode encoding scheme.

"2" is a String literal value because it is enclosed in double quotes. A String is an 
object which describes a sequence of characters. For example, words and sentences or any
other sequence of characters. A String literal is a value which can be stored in a String 
variable. 

"2.0" is also a String literal value because it is a sequence of characters enclosed by
double quotes. It can be stored in a String variable.
