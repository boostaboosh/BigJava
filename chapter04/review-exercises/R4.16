Explain what each of the following program segments computes.

a. x = 2;
y = x + x;

b. s = "2";
t = s + s;

A. Computes the sum of 2 plus 2 and assigns the result, i.e., 4, to the variable y.

B. Computes the concatenation of the String "2" and "2" and assigns the resulting
String, i.e., "22", to be stored in the variable t.
