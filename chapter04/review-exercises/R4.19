Write pseudocode for a program that computes the first and last digit of a number.
For example, if the input is 23456, the program should print 2 and 6. Hint: Use % and
Math.log10.

Step 1: understand the problem. What are the inputs and outputs?

There is one input: a number which is an integer

There are two outputs:
1 - the first digit of the input number
2 - the second digit of the input number

Step 2: work out examples by hand

Example input: 23455
Output: 2 5

Step 3: write pseudocode for computing the answers

numberOfDigits = round down ( logarithm base 10 of number ) + 1 )

firstDigit = number / (10 ^ (number of digits - 1)) // 10 ^ (numDigits - 1) is the value of the first digit's column because it's a base 10 number

Last digit = number % 10 // the remainder of a number mod 10 is the value of the first last digit, i.e., first column, of a number

Print firstDigit and lastDigit
