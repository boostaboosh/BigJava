Implement a class IceCreamCone with methods getSurfaceArea() and getVolume(). In the
constructor, supply the height and radius of the cone. Be careful when looking up
the formula for the surface areaâ€”you should only include the outside area along the
side of the cone because the cone has an opening on the top to hold the ice cream.

implementing a class for a given specification
step 1: find out which methods you are asked to supply
1 - get surface area
2 - get volume

step 2: specify the public interface - turn the list from step 1 into method declarations
This step is simpler if you write out method calls applied to a sample object:
IceCreamCone cornetto = new IceCreamCone(15, 5.5);
double cornettoConeSurfaceArea = cornetto.getSurfaceArea();
double cornettoConeVolume = cornetto.getVolume();

public interface:
methods:
public double getSurfaceArea()
public double getVolume()
constructor:
public IceCreamCone(double coneHeight, double coneRadius)

step 3: document the public interface
Write documentation comments that describe the class and its methods.

step 4: determine instance variables
Do not introduce unnecessary instance variables.
If a value can be computed on demand it is best to do so.

step 5: implement constructors and methods

getSurfaceArea method:
step 1: understand the problem - what are the inputs and outputs
inputs:
1 - height
2 - radius
outputs:
1 - curved surface area
step 2: work out examples by hand
example 1:
inputs: height = 15, radius = 2.75
lateral side length = square root of radius squared + height squared = 15.25
curved surface area = pi * radius * lateral side length = 3.14 * 2.75 * 15.25 = 131.68375
step 3: write pseudocode for computing the answers using the method you used for the hand-written examples
lateral side length = square root of radius squared + height squared
curved surface area = pi * radius * lateral side length
return curved surface area

getVolume method:
step 1: understand the problem - what are the inputs and outputs
inputs:
1 - height
2 - radius
outputs:
1 - cone volume
step 2: work out examples by hand
example 1:
inputs: height = 15, radius = 2.75
step 2: work out examples by hand
cone volume = (pi * radius squared * height) / 3.0 = 118.73125
step 3: write pseudocode for computing the answers using the method used for the hand-written examples
cone volume = (pi * radius squared * height) / 3.0
return cone volume

step 7: test your class
Write a short tester program and execute it.
The program should carry out the method calls that you found in step 2.
