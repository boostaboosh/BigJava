Write a program that reads a number between 1,000 and 999,999 from the user,
where the user enters a comma in the input. Then print the number without a
comma.
Here is a sample dialog; the user input is in color:
Please enter an integer between 1,000 and 999,999: 23,456
23456
Hint: Read the input as a string. Measure the length of the string. Suppose it contains
n characters. Then extract substrings consisting of the first n â€“ 4 characters and the
last three characters.

step 1: understand the problem - what are the inputs and outputs?
inputs:
1 - user inputted number between 1,000 and 999,999 with comma
outputs:
1 - the inputted number without the comma

step 2: work out examples by hand
example
inputs:
1 - 738,234
outputs:
1 - 738234

step 3: write pseudocode for computing the answers
output message to user saying to input number with comma between 1,000 and 999,999
numberWithComma = keyboard input
position of last letter = numberWithComma.length - 1
position of comma = position of last letter - 3
first half of number = string from position 0 to before comma
second half of number = string from after comma to end of string
output first half of number concatenated with second half of number
