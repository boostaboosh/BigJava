problem statement:
Write a program that asks the user to input
• The number of gallons of gas in the tank
• The fuel efficiency in miles per gallon
• The price of gas per gallon
Then print the cost per 100 miles and how far the car can go with the gas in the tank.

step 1: understand the problem - what are the inputs and outputs?

inputs:
1 - the number of gallons of fuel in the car fuel tank
2 - the fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon
3 - the price of gas per gallon

outputs:
1 - the cost of driving the car per 100 miles
2 - how far the car can go with the gas it currently has in its tank

step 2: work out examples by hand

the number of gallons in the car fuel tank: 34
the fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon: 14.2
the price of gas per gallon: 6.89

the cost of driving the car per 100 miles?
100 miles / fuel efficiency in miles per gallon = gallons of gas required to drive 100 miles
gallons of gas for 100 miles * price of gas per gallon = the cost of driving the car per 100 miles
100 / 14.2 = 7.04 gallons of gas required to drive 100 miles
7.04 * 6.89 = 48.52 cost in CAD of driving the car 100 miles

how far the car can go with the gas it currently has in its tank?
gallons of gas in tank * car mpg = miles the car can drive with the fuel currently in its tank
34 * 14.2 = 482.8

step 3: write pseudocode for computing the answers

input = keyboardInput
output "Enter gallons of gas currently in tank: "
gallonsInTank = nextDoubleInInput
output "Enter car fuel efficiency in MPG: "
fuelEfficiencyMPG = nextDoubleInput
output "Enter price of fuel per gallon: "
pricePerGallon = nextDoubleInput

gallonsPerHundredMiles = 100 / fuelEfficiencyMPG
costPerHundredMiles = gallonsPerHundredMiles * pricePerGallon
distanceRemaining = gallonsInTank * fuelEfficiencyMPG

output costPerHundredMiles
output distanceRemaining
