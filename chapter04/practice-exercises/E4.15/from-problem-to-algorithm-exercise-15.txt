Write a program that reads in an integer and breaks it into a sequence of individual
digits. For example, the input 16384 is displayed as
1 6 3 8 4
You may assume that the input has no more than five digits and is not negative.

step 1: understand the problem - what are the inputs and outputs?
inputs:
1 - an integer greater than zero with no more than 5 digits
outputs:
1 - the first digit of the input integer
2 - the other digits of the input integer one at a time

step 2: work out examples by hand
input: 54739
output: 5 4 7 3 9

input: 123
output: 0 0 1 2 3

input: 0
output: 0 0 0 0 0

step 3: write pseudocode that solves general instances of the problem
output message telling user to input number between 0 and 99999
number = keyboard input
first digit = number / 10000
second digit = (number / 1000) % 10
third digit = (number / 100) % 10
fourth digit = (number / 10) % 10
fifth digit = number % 10
output first digit + " " + second digit + " " + third digit + " " + fourth digit + " " + fifth digit
