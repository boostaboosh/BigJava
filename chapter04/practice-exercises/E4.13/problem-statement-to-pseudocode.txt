Write a program that reads a number between 1,000 and 999,999 from the user and
prints it with a comma separating the thousands. Here is a sample dialog; the user
input is in color:
Please enter an integer between 1000 and 999999: 23456
23,456

step 1: understand the problem - what are the inputs and outputs

inputs:
1 - an integer between 1000 and 999999
outputs:
1 - the input integer with a comma separating the thousands

step 2: work out examples by hand

input: 34500
output: 34,500

input: 234908
output: 234,908

input: 1400
output: 1,400

step 3: write and algorithm that completes the problem in general
output message telling user to input an integer between 1000 and 999999
input = user keyboard input
output message telling user to input an integer between 1000 and 999999
rightOfThousands = string from third last character to last character of input number
LeftOfHundreds = string from first character to fourth last characterr of input number
output leftOfHundreds + , + rightOfThousands
