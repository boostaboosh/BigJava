•• R15.4 Look up the descriptions of the methods addAll, removeAll, retainAll, and containsAll
in the Collection interface. Describe how these methods can be used to implement
common operations on sets (union, intersection, difference, subset).

The union of two sets A and B is a new set containing all distinct elements that are in A, B, or both.
The Collection interface addAll can be used to implement set union, because it adds all elements of the provided collection to the collection on which it is invoked, e.g. Collection C = collectionA.union(collectionB);

The intersection of two sets A and B is a set of elements common to both A and B.
The Collection interface retainAll method can be used to implement set intersection because it retains in the collection on which it is invoked only those elements that are also in the provided argument collection, and returns true if any items were removed. collectionA.retainAll(collectionB);

The difference A − B is a set of elements that are in A but not in B.
The Collection interface method removeAll can be used to implement the difference set operation on Collection objects in Java, because it removes all items from the set on which it is invoked which are also in the provided argument collection, e.g. collectionA.removeAll(collectionB);

Set A is a subset of B if every element in A is also in B.
The Collection interface method containsAll can be used to implement the subset set operation on Java Collection type objects because it returns true if every item in the collection provided to it as an argument is also an item in the collection on which it is invoked, e.g. collectionB.containsAll(collectionA);


Collection interface containsAll (subset), removeAll (difference), retainAll (intersection), and addAll (union) method descriptions from java api javadocs documentation:

addAll
boolean addAll​(Collection<? extends E> c)
Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this collection (optional operation). The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress. (This implies that the behavior of this call is undefined if the specified collection is this collection, and this collection is nonempty.)
Parameters:
c - collection containing elements to be added to this collection
Returns:
true if this collection changed as a result of the call
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException - if the addAll operation is not supported by this collection
ClassCastException - if the class of an element of the specified collection prevents it from being added to this collection
NullPointerException - if the specified collection contains a null element and this collection does not permit null elements, or if the specified collection is null
IllegalArgumentException - if some property of an element of the specified collection prevents it from being added to this collection
IllegalStateException - if not all the elements can be added at this time due to insertion restrictions
See Also:
add(Object)

removeAll
boolean removeAll​(Collection<?> c)
Removes all of this collection's elements that are also contained in the specified collection (optional operation). After this call returns, this collection will contain no elements in common with the specified collection.
Parameters:
c - collection containing elements to be removed from this collection
Returns:
true if this collection changed as a result of the call
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException - if the removeAll method is not supported by this collection
ClassCastException - if the types of one or more elements in this collection are incompatible with the specified collection (optional)
NullPointerException - if this collection contains one or more null elements and the specified collection does not support null elements (optional), or if the specified collection is null
See Also:
remove(Object), contains(Object)

retainAll
boolean retainAll​(Collection<?> c)
Retains only the elements in this collection that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation). In other words, removes from this collection all of its elements that are not contained in the specified collection.
Parameters:
c - collection containing elements to be retained in this collection
Returns:
true if this collection changed as a result of the call
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException - if the retainAll operation is not supported by this collection
ClassCastException - if the types of one or more elements in this collection are incompatible with the specified collection (optional)
NullPointerException - if this collection contains one or more null elements and the specified collection does not permit null elements (optional), or if the specified collection is null
See Also:
remove(Object), contains(Object)

containsAll
boolean containsAll​(Collection<?> c)
Returns true if this collection contains all of the elements in the specified collection.
Parameters:
c - collection to be checked for containment in this collection
Returns:
true if this collection contains all of the elements in the specified collection
Throws:
ClassCastException - if the types of one or more elements in the specified collection are incompatible with this collection (optional)
NullPointerException - if the specified collection contains one or more null elements and this collection does not permit null elements (optional), or if the specified collection is null.

contains(Object)
