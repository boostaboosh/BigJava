•• R15.1 An invoice contains a collection of purchased items. Should that collection be implemented as a list or set? Explain your answer.

Lists should be chosen as the implementation for a collection when I want to remember the order of elements in my collection, access elements based on their position in that order, and be able to add duplicate items to the collection.

Sets should be chosen as a collection implementation when I do not want to remember the order of elements in my collection, do not want to allow duplicate items, and want to be able to efficiently check if an item is already present in my collection.

Seeing as an invoice may contain duplicate items, for example when a customer purchases two of the same product, and both lists and sets allow searching for items, although sets are more efficient at this operation, the collection should be implemented as a list.

However, if invoice items are unique, for example if invoice items contain a quantity instance variable for representing how many copies of that product the customer wants to purchase, then there is no need for the collection to contain duplicate items, and a set is a better collection implementation, because adding and removing elements is more efficient, non duplication of elements is enforced, and checking if an element is contained in the invoice, for example in the invoice for a purchase with of lots of different items, is more efficient.
