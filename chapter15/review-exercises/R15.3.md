••• R15.3 One way of implementing a calendar is as a map from date objects to event objects.
However, that only works if there is a single event for a given date. How can you use
another collection type to allow for multiple events on a given date?

I could use a map of date objects to collections of event objects, e.g. Map<Date, Set<Event>> or Map<Date, List<Event>>.

Or I could have a list of event objects sorted by their date instance variable, e.g. List<EventWithDate>, but that would be inefficient, O(n), when finding all events for a given date, because I would have to iterate over potentially all n elements to check if their date matched the given date.
