•• E15.3 
Implement the sieve of Eratosthenes: a method for com-
puting prime numbers, known to the ancient Greeks. 
This method will compute all prime numbers up to n. Choose an
n. First insert all numbers from 2 to n into a set. Then erase
all multiples of 2 (except 2); that is, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, . . . . 
Erase all multiples of 3; that is, 6, 9, 12, 15, . . . . 
Go up to the square root of n. 
Then print the set.
