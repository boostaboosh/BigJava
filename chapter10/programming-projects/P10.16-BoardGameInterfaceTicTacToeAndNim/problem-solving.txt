• P10.16
Your task is to design a general program for managing board games with two players.

Your program should be flexible enough to handle games such as tic-tac-toe,
chess, or the com.game.Game of Nim of Exercise P6.5.

Design an interface com.game.Game that describes a board game.

Think about what your program needs to do.

It asks the first player to input a move—a string in a game-specific format,
such as Be3 in chess.

Your program knows nothing about specific games, so the com.game.Game interface must have a method such as
boolean isValidMove(String move)

Once the move is found to be valid, it needs to be executed—the interface needs
another method executeMove.

Next, your program needs to check whether the game is over.
If not, the other player’s move is processed.

You should also provide some mechanism for displaying the current state
of the board.

Design the com.game.Game interface
and provide two implementations of your choice—such as Nim and Chess
(or TicTacToe if you are less ambitious).

Your com.game.GamePlayer class should manage a com.game.Game reference without knowing
which game is played, and process the moves from both players.

Supply two programs that differ only in the initialization
of the Game reference.
