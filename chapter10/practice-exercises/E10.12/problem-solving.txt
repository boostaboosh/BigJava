•• E10.12
Implement a class Bag that stores items represented as strings. Items can be repeated.
Supply methods for adding an item, and for counting how many times an item has
been added:
public void add(String itemName)
public int count(String itemName)
Your Bag class should store the data in an ArrayList<Item>, where Item is an inner class
with two instance variables: the name of the item and the quantity.
