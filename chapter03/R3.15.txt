Suppose you want to implement a class TimeDepositAccount. A time deposit account
has a fixed interest rate that should be set in the constructor, together with the initial
balance. Provide a method to get the current balance. Provide a method to add the
earned interest to the account. This method should have no arguments because the
interest rate is already known. It should have no return value because you already
provided a method for obtaining the current balance. It is not possible to deposit
additional funds into this account. Provide a withdraw method that removes the entire
balance. Partial withdrawals are not allowed.

/** 
	Constructs a time deposit account with a given interest rate and initial balance
	@param interestRate the fixed interest rate of the time deposit account
	@param initialBalance the initial balance of the time deposit account
*/
public TimeDepositAccount(double interestRate, double initialBalance)
{
	this.fixedInterestRate = interestRate;
	this.balance = initialBalance;
}

/**
	Retrieves the current account balance
	@return the current balance of the TimeDepositAccount
*/
public double getBalance()
{
	return this.balance;
}

/**
	Adds the earned interest to the account
*/
Public void addEarnedInterest()
{
	double earnedInterest = this.balance * this.fixedInterestRate / 100;
	this.balance = this.balance + earnedInterest;
}

/**
	Withdraws the entire balance from the account
	@return the total balance of the account which has been withdrawn
*/
public double withdraw()
{
	double withdrawal = this.balance;
	this.balance = 0;
	return withdrawal;
}
