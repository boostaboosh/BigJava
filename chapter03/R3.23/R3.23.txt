Design a modification of the BankAccount class in which the first five transactions per
month are free and a $1 fee is charged for every additional transaction. Provide a
method that deducts the fee at the end of a month. What additional instance variables
do you need? Using the object tracing technique described in Section 3.5, trace a
scenario that shows how the fees are computed over two months. 

I need a single additional instance variable that keeps track of the number of transactions
made by a bank account.
