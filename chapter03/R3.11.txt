What happens in our implementation of the BankAccount class when more money is
withdrawn from the account than the current balance?

35 /**
36 Withdraws money from the bank account.
37 @param amount the amount to withdraw
38 */
39 public void withdraw(double amount)
40 {
41 balance = balance - amount;
42 }
43

In our implementation of the BankAccount class when more money is withdrawn from the account 
than the current balance of the bank account, the balance instance variable of the implicit parameter (the bank account object on which the withdraw method is invoked) becomes negative.
