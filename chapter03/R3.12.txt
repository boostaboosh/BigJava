What is the this reference? Why would you use it?

In Java the this reference refers to the implicit parameter of a method, i.e., the object
on which a method was invoked.

One way I would use it is inside a constructor or method body where one of the parameters has 
the same name as one of the classes instance variables. 
This way I can specify that the variable I am referring to is the instance variable of the 
object on which the method is being invoked (known as the implicit parameter). Otherwise
A parameter variable will shadow an object's instance variable and impede me from referring to
it.
Additionally, the this reference makes program instructions more readable and removes the 
ambiguity from using a name which belongs to both a parameter variable and an instance variable.
The this reference also makes a program more readable if I'm invoking a method from inside a 
method because it makes it clear that I am invoking the method on this, i.e., the object that 
invoked the outer method (the implicit parameter).
