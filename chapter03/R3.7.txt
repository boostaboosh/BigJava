Suppose the implementor of the Time class of Exercise •• R3.6 changes from one
implementation strategy to another, keeping the public interface unchanged. What
do the programmers who use the Time class need to do?

The application programmers who use the Time class do not need to do anything if 
the system programmers of the Time class change the implementation of the Time 
class and keep the public interface unchanged.
This is because the behaviour of Time objects remains the same if the public 
interface of the class remains the same.
This is one of the benefits of encapsulation, i.e., information hiding. 
In Java the class construct provides encapsulation.
System programmers can modify how an object works under the hood without users 
of the object having to know or make changes to their program that uses said 
object if the interface of the object remains the same.
