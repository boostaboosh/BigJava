What does the following method do? Give an example of how you can call the
method.
public class BankAccount
{
 public void mystery(BankAccount that, double amount)
 {
 this.balance = this.balance - amount;
 that.balance = that.balance + amount;
 }
 . . . // Other bank account methods
}

The mystery method takes two arguments: a BankAccount object and a value of type double.
The mystery method executes two instructions.
The mystery method has three parameters: the implicit parameter which is the BankAccount object
on which it is invoked and the that and amount parameters.
First, it sets the balance instance variable of the object on which it was invoked to the 
value of the balance instance variable minus the amount passed to the amount parameter.
Second, it sets the balance instance variable of the implicit parameter to the value of the 
balance instance variable plus the value of the amount parameter.
In other words, the mystery method subtracts and then adds the same amount from and to the bank
account object on which it is invoked, thereby not changing the value of the balance instance
variable of the implicit parameter after the method is executed compared to before it was 
executed.
Basically, it has no meaningful effect on the bank account object on which it is invoked.
