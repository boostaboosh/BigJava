You can read the value instance variable of the Counter class with the getValue accessor
method. Should there be a setValue mutator method to change it? Explain why or
why not.

There should not be a SetValue mutator method to change the value of counter objects
because there is already a mutator method which increases the value of counter objects 
by one. Therefore, I do not want to provide an additional method for changing a counter object's 
value instance variable because it is not necessary, and it adds functionality to counter
objects which counters should not have, i.e., being able to set their value to any number with
one action.
