Consider a class Time that represents a point in time, such as 9 a.m. or 3:30 p.m.
Give two different sets of instance variables that can be used for implementing the
Time class.

1st set of instance variables:
	public int hours;
	public int minutes;

2nd set of instance variables:
	public double time;

3rd set of instance variables:
	public String time;
