R3.4 Instance variables are a part of the hidden implementation of a class, but they arenâ€™t
actually hidden from programmers who have the source code of the class. Explain to
what extent the private reserved word provides information hiding.

The private reserved word which is used when declaring an instance variable of a class is the instance variable access specifier. 
It specifies that the instance variable is private, therefore it can only be accessed by methods of the same class, not by any other method.
Other methods that are not of the same class as a private instance variable need to use methods of the instance variable's class if they want to manipulate the internal data of an object of that class.
